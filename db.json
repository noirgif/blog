年的时候还在高中奋斗，博客连博客的一横都没有。\n\n<del>自称在下是不是也行？</del>从历史来看，最早的时候站点是用 Hexo + Disqus 做的，也就是本博客现在用的系统。本博客创立 4 年后会不会也用 Hugo 呢？现在 Go 2 已经在筹备， 2021 年还会有多少人用 Go 呢？我不知道。说不定本博客甚至会在 Go 之前寿终正寝，所以还是不要太乐观为好。\n\n博主是 ACM 队员出身，而我向来尊敬那些玩 ACM 玩的好的人。我自己初中的时候 OI 其实并不怎么样，上了高中变成半放弃状态（这跟我去搞数学竞赛也有关系，大概），到大学就基本不碰了。所以可以说，我看 ACM 人的眼光，就像是在地上的人仰望展翅翱翔的伊卡洛斯一样：他们在做我没有做到的事。\n\n虽然伊卡洛斯最后摔死了，但我做这个比喻没有这层意思。真的，不骗你。\n\n## 老 fc 的博客\n\n[老fc的博客](https://farseerfc.me)\n\n穿过 fars.ee ，我们到达了 Farseerfc 的博客。\n\n卡片式的设计，让人想起谷歌的 Material 风格。<del>当然实际上跟 Material 其实一点都不搭边，这大概就是所谓的*見栄を張る* 吧。</del>看了关于主题的博文，先确认是基于 Material 的 FC 自主风格。\n\n老 fc 的一些个人信息在 about 页可以找到，不像老涡需要在一篇篇博客中找寻蛛丝马迹。作为一些补充，他是 Archlinux 的 Trusted User，负责管理 community repo 以及其他的一些东西。\n\n最早的一篇博客在 2006 年……算了。这已经不是高中初中的水平了。\n\n博客里只有一两篇博文的水平属于硬核科普类，就是懂的都能看懂，不懂的根本看不懂的那种。除此之外的都是贴地气的水平。\n\n2013 年有一篇博客叫《嫁给我好吗》。对！\n\n嫁给我好吗！\n\n我的脸和笔记本都在发烫，大概是 WebGL 的原因吧。\n\n## 老狐的博客\n\n[老狐的博客](https://blog.megumifox.com)\n\nHello world. 可以说是每一个写程序的人都要经历的通过仪式。在这种意义上， 老狐的博客记录的是一个人成长的历程。据本人（我不自称本人，虽然我认识一个自称本人的人）说下学期（大概是 2019 春季）开始会记录一些课堂上的内容，这无疑会给成长增添一层新的含义。\n\n博客的主题非常简洁舒适。在这种意义上我喜欢这个博客胜过 fc 的博客。<del>loser 的互舔伤疤</del>\n\n因为博客内容目前来说还很少，没法通过内容凑数，所以用一些别的东西好了。\n\n说到用 Megumi 命名的人物，可能大家最先想到的就是丸户史明原作轻小说 Saekano 《不起眼女主角的培育方法》里的加藤惠。漩涡最近（2018.12.5 现在）刚刚经过 fc 购买了全套的 Saekano ，并 po 了一篇博客。我们这里[一个大跳 A 过去](https://xuanwo.io/2018/12/03/hello-katou-megumi/)欣赏一下。\n\n这样前三个人就紧密的联系起来了，不愧是我。\n\n说到狐狸，在日本神道中，有被称作稻荷的狐神，稻荷神是象征稻子的农耕神，同时也是食物之神。稻荷也用来指油炸豆皮，比如稻荷寿司，就是用油炸豆皮包上馅的寿司，而加入油炸豆皮的面就被称为狐狸。我个人有幸吃过包醋饭的稻荷寿司，软酥的炸豆皮，配上微酸的醋饭，非常对我的胃口，一次能吃 10 个。\n\n饿了。\n\n## 老肯的博客\n\n[老肯的博客](https://blog.yoitsu.moe)\n\n偷偷把老肯的博客也加进来。\n\n非常正点的 Material Design ，连我这种外行人都能看出来的程度。和老 fc 一样用 Pelican 打造。\n\n网站很大程度上受支仓冻砂原作的轻小说《狼与香辛料》里女主人公的赫萝的启发。头像就是赫萝本人，颜色是赫萝发色的橙色，站点名取自赫萝的故乡 Yoitsu， 爱用“咱”“汝”“呐”。老肯的 ID KenOokamiHolo ，也不出例外，来自贤狼赫萝（Kenrou Holo），在此基础上训读狼字，得到KenOokami Holo。\n\n贤，即聪明。耳聪目明，是一个音游玩家必备的素质。耳聪，指能听出旋律。目明，指能看清音符。就像稳准狠是拍苍蝇必须的三点一样，玩音游也必须要这两点。自称贤狼，在某种意义上，也是朝着这一目标看齐。\n\n说到支仓，这个人可以说是非常喜欢兽耳了。他的作品《狼与香辛料》（包括续作羊皮纸），《梦沉抹大拉》（坑了，还好没看），女主人公都是长着一对兽耳。其社团 Spicy Tails 作品《WEE》也提供了猫耳 patch，*搞什么呢*。\n\n虽然会混一些近况报告，但绝大多数都是由技术贴构成的。\n\n## 这样下去不行啊，老奎\n\n( ・_・)\n\n由于数据库实验要求写一个图形化界面，因此我曾经用 Express.js + MySQL 写了一个简陋的数据库前端。这玩意现在还放在 GitHub 上。\n\n做的事情是在网页上用 Javascript 访问 Express.js 提供的 API 获取数据，以生成表格以及图表。图表部分由于用了特定的复杂查询（如求和啊，过滤之类的），因此整个程序变得不简洁，也就没放到 GitHub 上去，大概没有放上去。\n\n总之这个架构是这样：根据 query 的不同，由 Javascript 向 HTTP 服务器请求 raw data ，再由进行渲染。\n\n而这，基本就是[老奎的博客](https://quininer.github.io) 的框架。\n\n所以打开博客里的一篇文章的顺序如下：\n\n1. 第一个 RTT，发送 GET 请求，获取 HTML 文件\n2. 第二个 RTT，发送请求获取 HTML 文件中的 js 文件，在这里，主要是 main.js 和 ice.js，以及文法高亮的 highlight.js\n3. 第三个 RTT，执行 Javascript ：在 js 代码中，发送 HTTP 请求，获取 Markdown 以及 CSS 文件\n4. 对获取的 Markdown 进行渲染并显示\n\n而且文章没有渲染好的时候是不会显示，因此博客内容要 2 个 RTT 之后才会显示。\n\n其实如果加载文章以及 CSS 的代码如果直接内嵌在 HTML 里，就不需要等待获取和执行 js 文件了，不过已经无所谓了。\n\n另外 Disquz 评论<del>显示不出来</del>被关了。老奎！这样是不行的！\n\n如果希望了解老奎是怎样的一个人，还是推荐去[他的推](https://twitter.com/quininers) 逛逛，因为在他的博客上你只能听听《Arrietty's Song》，看几篇密码学相关了。\n\n## 老艾的博客\n\n[老艾的博客](https://axionl.me)\n\n拖了很久很久。这篇早该写了，我告诉自己。但事实上，我总拿不出一点契机来促使自己坐在电脑前，敲打薄膜键盘。仿佛夏日的幻象一般，越是靠近，越清楚它遥不可及。\n\n唯一不像海市蜃楼的是，造成这一切的，毫无疑问都是我自己。所谓契机，只是我拿的些虚无缥缈的东西，掩盖住下面吝于见人的自己的，一件简陋的蓑衣而已。\n\n我可以说，我很喜欢 Sakuzyo 的曲子（例如 lost memory 这种），而老艾的名字又有 Axion 在里面。或者说最近看了 Maquia ，片中男主角的名字叫 Ariel 。如果我静下心来问问自己，这些是否都是真正动笔的缘由呢。\n\n都不是，我对我自己说。到头来，我写点什么东西，还是因为我想写罢了。\n\n我不想写了，于是契机便消失了。\n\n关于老艾这个人，我想我知之甚少。我见过老艾平静，见过他嬉笑，见过他怒骂。但老艾是什么样的人，我很难说，我对这个问题有那么一点斤两。毕竟仅仅是网络上的，透过文字的了解。但也许比仅有透过文字的了解更糟糕的，是根本没有想去了解。\n\n表面上对他人敞开了心扉，事实上，却什么都进不来。我想，这份冷漠才是真正的问题所在吧。\n\n关于老艾的博客，虽然开张比我的晚半年（自满），但论其内容是可以算是，Arch 风味的，标称的 Tech blog 的。这个页面上的，除了老涡和老狐的博客，都是技术向的博客（老奎的偏向科学，所以也应排除在外）。我会钦佩人的纯粹，单纯的去分享。我，就不愿把自己学到的半斤八两的知识，裱上金闪闪的边框，陈列在博客里供人观赏，可能这和我才疏学浅也有关系：我感觉，我学到的，都有人写过博客了。\n\n可我有时候还是会有写一点什么的冲动。这冲动就像想叫别人 RTFM 的冲动一样难以抑制。这两者好像是矛盾的。不过，如果能写出一步一步，手把手的技术文章来，那也就是一本新的、特化的 manual 了。\n\n话说回来，我想写一些只有我会写出来的东西。可现在的我真的做到了吗。\n\n或许没有。或许有。总之，有个目标应该不是坏的。\n\nP.S. 老艾的博文页面，左上角有一个小书签的图标，点它虽然没有什么可见的效果，但是点起来如同蜗牛伸缩的触角一般，颇有手感。\n\n## 老乔的博客\n\n[老乔的博客](https://blog.nanpuyue.com/)\n\n 老乔也是老油条了，2014年本科毕业（这年我还没入学），毕业后曾经在 Deepin 工作过一段时间。 2012 年就有了一篇关于 Deepin 的文章，这时老乔大三，也就是说，他和 Deepin 的不解之缘从本科就开始了。\n\n 令我感触很深的一篇是 [2015年9月6日，记博客迁移到 Typecho](https://blog.nanpuyue.com/2015/030.html) 。虽然只有短短几段，但从字里行间，可以感受到一种淡淡的无奈。\n\n 本博客应该也是从 2017 年， hexo 框架开始的 。不过本博客从一开始我就很懒，没自己写主题（我记得自己不止一次地想改目前的架构，但是没有动过一个手指头）。看现在的博客框架，有用 Go 的 Hugo（见上），有很好多语言支持的 Pelican（见上），还有自制框架的（见上），用 nodejs ，而且很多插件年久失修的 hexo 就感觉比较束手束脚了（主要还是我不会写 Node.js，以及渲染引擎的 Jinja 也不会用）。老乔迁到了 Typecho ，我却连迁都懒得迁。\n \n 总而言之，与我相比，老乔算是非常爱折腾（褒义）的人了。\n\n 不过这也是到 2015 年为止了。从那以后，老乔的博客就没再迁过。\n\n或许是来自工作、生活的压力，或许是爱好的变化，当初兴致勃勃，蓦然回首，已经兴味阑珊。从\"make things work as I want\" 变成仅仅的 \"make things work\" 。不仅是老乔，我自己身上也慢慢发生着这种变化。\n\n 回顾这些年来的心路历程，就像是在小溪边上行走。看到了漂亮的鹅卵石，就捡起来带走。渐渐的，走过的路越来越多，鹅卵石的重量也变得难以承受。于是，原来一些视若至珍的鹅卵石，就被放下了。放下的时候，感觉当一些重负卸去后，轻轻松松就能回来重拾这些石头，但直到最后，也没有再捡起来。\n\n希望多年以后，再看到这个博客，如果我想到的是：“哈！我当时原来对这个着迷啊。”然后小小沈浸在过去一会儿，我就满足了。老乔博客中记录的点点滴滴，或多或少也是类似的东西吧。","source":"links/index.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

年的时候还在高中奋斗，博客连博客的一横都没有。</p>\n<p><del>自称在下是不是也行？</del>从历史来看，最早的时候站点是用 Hexo + Disqus 做的，也就是本博客现在用的系统。本博客创立 4 年后会不会也用 Hugo 呢？现在 Go 2 已经在筹备， 2021 年还会有多少人用 Go 呢？我不知道。说不定本博客甚至会在 Go 之前寿终正寝，所以还是不要太乐观为好。</p>\n<p>博主是 ACM 队员出身，而我向来尊敬那些玩 ACM 玩的好的人。我自己初中的时候 OI 其实并不怎么样，上了高中变成半放弃状态（这跟我去搞数学竞赛也有关系，大概），到大学就基本不碰了。所以可以说，我看 ACM

With this weapon we can wrap up a story easily. SCP-8900-EX is a near example.</p>\n"},{"title":"rec-4-16-2018","_content":"\n## Computer Graphics\n\nKawase's filter is very simple.

Busted","date":"2018-04-01T05:00:00.000Z","lang":"en","label":"fall of compire","_content":"\n\nThe video game developer, Compile Heart Inc., has recently announced its bankruptcy, according to Noirina International Reports. The developer who's had the hands on War of Agarest series, the franchise of Neptunia, has finally meet its fate because of its overspending and decision mistakes.\n\nCompile Heart was a video game developer, set up as the complete subsidiary of Idea Factory by Shingo Kuwana, who was the CEO of Idea Factory. It was more like a brand than a child company of IF, just like how FAVORITE and Omega-Star were to CROSSNET. When Compile Heart focused on moe games, another brand of IF, Otomate, majored in Otome games, as its name suggests.\n\nYear 2015 witnessed a major success of Compile Heart, when the Megadimension Neptunia was launched. The game, features three stories in three dimensions, was said to be well crafted and organized.

Despite being a visual novel, a genre which only a minority would enjoy because of its lack of playability, the game received positive critical reviews, scoring a 97% in its over 40k reviews(as of Dec 18, 2017), which is a feat given the reviews are from a larger group of players, rather than a small bunch of loyal fans(like *Megadimension Neptunia*, it has a 98% positive, but only out of 1.6k reviews).\n\nSo let's dig into it a little bit.\n\nAs a galgame(at least it looks like one), DDLC features four cute schoolgirls: Sayori, the outgoing childhood friend, and vice president of the club; Natsuki, a tiny figure who likes baking and watching manga; Yuri, a composed schoolgirl who behaves with maturity; and Monika, president of the club, who is lively and thoughtful. Your goal is to have a great festival with them, and finally, get one of the girl's heart, as the [store page](http://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/) suggests. The story is set in a highschool, so all of the four girls are (probably) underaged, Valve's inhumane censorship makes publishing a erotic game on Steam pratically a impossibility, but there are still ways, out of Steam.\n\nAt least that's what everybody expected on seeing its download page. Though it says that the game is not for those who are easily disturbed, maybe it's just too disturbing in a *sexual* sense. You know, sexy, nudity, common traits of these galgames. Even a [game calling itself R18](http://store.steampowered.com/app/416130/) can make its way onto Steam(but it's garbage, like some other censored games), so one may assume that Valve is sometimes lenient to these things, which is never the case. Even an all-aged game, [Ie no Kagi](http://ugainovel.web.fc2.com/ienoKagi/), [was deleted by Valve in suspect of pedophilia](https://steamcommunity.com/app/710370/discussions/0/1499000547482233373/). So some just cut it off, like what they do to a minigame in Mugen Souls, which doesn't hurt much. But for some others where it's an important part, while the games on Steam are PG, have R18 patches distributed, for free(like those sakura games) or with a price(sold on Denpasoft). So such ecchi elements(*oiroke youso* in Japanese) is not that unacceptable, but rather, welcome for me.\n\nBut it turns out not to be the case for DDLC. Quite the opposite. After witnessing Nekopara's **first person shooter** tag, someone might think it's another joke upon the first sight of the tags of DDLC. However, this time there's no joke. DDLC, as the tag **psychological horror** suggests, is actually a story full of scares, revealing a darker side of personality. The same tag for *Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy*, on the other hand, is only a funny reference to the game's extraordinary difficulty.\n\n## Doki-doki school life\n\nThe game begins with a cliche VN plot, the main protagonist(the player names him), on an invitation from his childhood friend, Sayori, decides to actually pay a visit to the club she's in -- the literature club. There he meets the other three girls in the club: Natsuki making cupcakes for everyone, Yuri bringing him a book to read and at last, president Monika, regarding the iminnent school festival, proposes that everyone writes a poem, and brings it the second day to share with each other to enhance mutual communication and writing skills.\n\nAnd here comes the game's main mechanism. To compose a poem, you need to have 20 words, each of them chosen from 10 words. Every word appeals most to a specific heroine, and the hint is given during the day: Yuri loves something abstract and metaphorical, while cute words like lollipop or kawaii are appealing to Natsuki. And about Sayori, she have an inclination towards human emotion, and is drawn to both words for happiness and ones for sadness, which is made clear in the second day. The girl's storyline will progress who is the most pleased. There are stickers of the girls showing on the left while making a poem. When a word is chosen, the corresponding girl will jump, making an easy indicator.\n\nThe girls react differently to the poems, as one may suppose. That is, if you write a poem that attracts Sayori most, for Natsuki it will be tepid. And if you write a \"Yuri\" poem on the second day, after Natsuki and Yuri had a quarrel about writing style, Natsuki may even feel sorry for that she has insulted the style of both Yuri and the MC, and runs away. Of course, as a part of the sharing, you will read the poems written by the four girls, and they are mostly identical to their word preference.\n\nThe true nature of the game is hidden till now, but clues are given here and there. Monika's Writing Tips on the second day is a fourth-wall breaking one: save the game when you're doing an important decision. On the third day, Sayori becomes a bit off, and she's written a poem, which is really creepy according to the MC: \n{% blockquote Sayori, Bottle%}\nThey were supposed to be for my friends, my friends who aren't smiling.\nThey're all shouting, pleading. Something.\nBut all I hear is echo, echo, echo, echo, echo\nInside my head\n{% endblockquote %}\n\nThe poem managed to take a toll on my sanity. And Yuri's poem today seems a mite uncanny as well. It tells a story of 'I' and a raccoon. 'I' feed the raccoon with bread crumbs every day, and as a result the raccoon grows excitement when 'I' show the very knife used for cutting bread. In the end of the poem:\n{% blockquote Yuri, The Raccoon %}\nA rush of blood. Classic Pavlovian conditioning. I slice the bread.\nAnd I feed myself again.\n{% endblockquote %}\n\nBut to my relief, Yuri seems to be normal, yes, normal, after all, for now. You can even witness her cuteness if you choose to help her out on the fourth day. And she's like cuuuuuuuuteeeeeeee, the embarassment after her licking <del>your</del> main protagonist's hurt finger is good. I don't really think that way. I'm just pretending to be innocent. Unconscious finger licking is just too archetypal for an anime girl, because it can show the girl's other side of loveliness, in spite of how elegant and composed she might usually be.\n\nSo I just root for Natsuki for the weekend event. In this case, <del>you</del> the MC does a *Kabedon* on Natsuki, but still, the conversations are not as romantic or passionate as one may expect. Everyday stuff with a little teasing, and that's it. It kind of fits my ideal of a good relationship between a boy and a girl, something of Platonic love. I'm not debasing sexual relationship, but pure love is, to me, more precious given the prevalence of the prior one. Cause Sayori is helping out Monika, you cannot choose to help either of them.\n\nBack to this morning. The welcomed protag decides to visit Sayori before Natsuki/Yuri's arrival. Sayori reveals that she suffers from heavy depression, and hope that the he just forget about her and get along with other girls. But she also admits her feeling heartbroken seeing his having a good time with them, without actually realizing that it's out of jealousy. Sayori shows up again, and after Natsuki/Yuri is gone, she confesses her love for our protagonist. Here you have two options: accept it or not. If you choose to accept it, the two of them hugs each other and on and on. If not, Sayori breaks down, with a cry she runs away.\n\nI'm glad I choosed to confess the love in my first run. Hope I've brought her some \"hxppy thxughts\"[1](#happy-thoughts).\n\nEither way, on the day of the festival, you'll see her last poem on the literature club's pamphlet. Named *%*, it's dark and well, a lot creepier than her second poem. \n\n{% blockquote Sayori, % %}\n<span style=\"white-space:nowrap;margin:auto -100% auto auto;margin:auto calc(50% - 50vw) auto auto;\">Get out of my head.

It's a part of the poet themself, whether about their feelings or experiences. In this sense, all poems written by the same people are in fact a continuous flow of the poet's personal experiences. So a poem can never be finished in this way, it's just like some underground rivers, some streams seemingly seperated by rocks are in fact connected together. And if this flow just stops moving...think you get the point.\n\nThe poem reminds one of everything. Of her creepy one on the third day, of her leave on Friday, of her telling you she's suffering from heavy depression in the weekend.\n\nNo, it can't be. I keep assuring myself. It's just a mediocre visual novel, only appealing to those weebs who can't even stand a non-virgin, easily afraid theres no way Sayori will do something she's fine just a little depression wont do anything shes fine shes fine shes fine she must be fine god she must be fine\n\nBut that feeling can't go away.\n\nThe screen turns black after you enter Sayori's house. When it goes bright again, Sayori is there.\n\nHer body is there.\n\nAnd everything speeds from bad to worse henceforth. The game restarts, but this time without Sayori. Her sprite in the title screen is replaced by an amalgam of the other members' pixels. All previous saves become unloadable(saying you cannot find Sayori's character file) and then deleted. Then the story unrolls as if Sayori never existed.\n\nNow the game have glitches here and there, and things are exacerbating for Natsuki and Yuri. They have a quarrel on the same day as before, but without Sayori this time, it remains unchecked. \n\nIf you've triggered Natsuki's event this day, she'll faint while talking to the protagonist, which, by Monika, is due to her malnutrition. And Natsuki hints that she's suffering from home abuse. When it comes to Yuri, she begins to show somewhat excessive obsession with MC. It's like the first run, but the world is falling apart.\n\nFear of the unknown may be a little more fundamental than other phobias. One is constantly scared, because what comes next is beyond imagination.\n\nIt's said that prepare for the worst. Ironically, sometimes the same thing applies to our fear, too. The worst thought pops in our mind, usually when it's most unwanted. Horror games try to exploit this. They don't scare you all the time, instead they create a ghastly environment, and the player's mind will do the rest.\n\nBut DDLC is not entirely getting at it. Though Salvato, its creater, decided to make something eerie with a sugar coat, there's something, other than pure horror in the game. Without it, DDLC would be a lot less special.\n\nThat's meta. Sometimes I find my self unable to resist the charm of those self references and fourth-wall breaking stuff.\n\n## Beyond the topsy-turvy\n\n{% alert danger %}\nYou've come a long way here, which means about half the plot has been spoiled already. No turning back if you go on reading.\nIf you do have some interest, why not stop here and play the game right away? It's free and takes just a couple of hours to go through, definitely worth a try.\n\nAnd unfortunately, some other innocent games will be spoiled just because they bear some relevance. Amen.\n\nThe names of the games aren't listed here in case of being a spoiler.\n\n{% endalert %}\n\nFrom its greek definition, a metagame should be a game about games, or a game beyond games. \n\nIt's nothing new. After all, Shakespeare wrote meta-dramas centuries ago. You can make a game about making games, just like what lightnovel writers have been doing recently. Shion Momone, Masamune Izumi, Hashima Itsuki, all of them. The author of *Noucome* is working on a new one in this genre, too, and the first volume is interesting.\n\nSega, near its end of life in the console war, made a game called *Segagaga*. In this game the player assumes Taro Sega, trying to save Sega by making a great game ,beating the rivaling company DOGMA (a parody of Sony, one of its main competitors back then), and capture as much market share as possible. Ironic jokes and parodies throughout the play make the game a mite different. But it cannot compare to the *Seaman*, another game published by Sega, in the sense of weirdness. In the game, the player brings up and interact with a man-faced fish.\n\nAnd the eccentricity also exists in the first parts of DDLC.\n\nWithout Sayori, one can say the first act is just about ordinary school life, and in the second act, a horrible one. It’s like Danganronpa, where there’s a chapter of (un)common life and then another about class trial.\n\n---\n\nMonika \nMonika\nMonika shows up, and upon entering the classroom, she realizes that she has screwed it all. So she deletes Yuri and Natsuki’s character file and cleans up the mess. And it’s progressing on to Act 3.\n\nThe game restarts again, and this time, <del>the protagonist</del>the player sits with Monika, face to face. But unlike other girls, Monika face right to the screen in the whole gameplay, so it’s always the case.\n\nMøn ka admits that she’s the culprit of all the terrible school life, however, it’s due to her obssession with the player, the only reality in the world of fiction.\n\nAll of a sudden, M̶o̶n̶ìką realized all the other members of the literature club were nothing but a piece of code, and their characters were just some archetypes common in Japanese anime, game and stuff. Frantically wanting to be together with the player, she abuses her privilege as the president, forces the player to choose to help her at the weekend, and even interferes with the personality of other girls. \n\nAt the price of the game itself.\n\nBut deleting the character file of others, and even telling how to do it to the player, who she believes would never betray her, turn out to be her undoings. In this act M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a will talk about some random topics, and some of them are thought provoking. The eternity lasts, until the player deletes her character file.\n\nBeing removed leads to Monika reflecting on herself about what she's done to Sayori, Natsuki, Yuri, and also, the player. She apologizes for ruining the player's experience as I'm now doing, and admits though fictitious, they're still her friends. So she decides to restore the world to its initial state. A world the player desires. And a world without Monika.\n\nEverything seems on track at first. Sayori thanks the player for making the other girls happy, and...\n\nAnd for getting rid of Monika. As the new president of the literature club, Sayori has obtained the ability that is once Monika's. Trying to use it to be with the player forever, Sayori is stopped short by Monika. In the end, Monika says, the Literature Club is no more than a place of grief and despair, so she decides to disband it. \n\nThen Monika plays her song Your Reality(she picked up the piano for it), while the graphics are displayed. They are removed in the end, along with the game files.\n\n{% quote %}\nIf I don't know how to love you\nI'll leave you be\n{% endquote %}\n\nFrom here on, the game won't start. Instead, a farewell message from Monika is displayed.\n\nIf all CGs are seen, there's an alternative end, where Sayori and the developer thank you and that's it. That marks the end of the game.\n\nSo in its essence, DDLC is a VN, or it tries to be one, but ended up being a melting pot of love, horror, and meta. Though, DDLC isn't the first one to do that. The first with file manipulation in mind may be the computer tutorials. Also, years ago, there's a game called [OneShot](http://store.steampowered.com/app/420530/OneShot/) that used similar tricks.\n\nIn this game, the sun died out, which has been providing energy to the world. And our protagonist, Niko, wakes up with a lightbulb in hand. They know from the prophet the lightbulb is the new sun, and Niko, the savior. Player's goal is to guide Niko to the tower and put the new sun into its place.\n\nBut it's not that simple as it seems. During the pilgrimage, some puzzles requires the player to find something on the computer, instead of from inside the game. Yes, at a time the game places some files in your document directory for you to solve the problems in game. And in another situation, it even resets your desktop background for hints. And the ways to solve them, sometimes, also feature the same technique: you may need to drag the game window to reveal the hidden information, or, close it to progress to the next scene.\n\nIn the last part of the journey, the player comes to know that the sun needs the savior to operate, that is, if Niko returns the sun to the world, they cannot return to their own home. And if Niko smash the lightbulb, they can return, but at the expense of this world.\n\nAnd it's decisive. If Niko sacrifices themself for everybody's sake, when you restart the game, only the starting room is shown, bathed in light, without Niko's presence. If you choose the other route, Niko goes back to their home, but the game will fail to start due to the world's destruction.\n\n{% quote %}\nYou only have one shot.\n{% endquote %}\n\nDon't know how they managed this in the remake version, but in the original version, the registry of the computer is modified to maintain the state across installations. Games becomes scrupulous when they become commercial(and when they go on Steam), so it may not dare to play with the registry now.\n\nHowever unsurprisingly, OneShot closes itself in a non-oneshot way. That's in the solstice update. In this route, things become clear that the world has come to its end already, and the current one is none but a clone, a piece of code running on Player's machine. But the Entity, the mind of the game itself, is \"untamed\"(you can interpret it as insensible), and started to self-destruct in order to protect the innocent victim trapped in the game, that is Niko. Now Niko needs to face the Entity to save the virtual world, and, to return home.\n\nAt a time you even need to move character files into a folder to transport their figures in the game! Only computer tutorials can force one to do that! Maybe the puzzle of deleting a character file comes out of here, we just don't know. Let's just state it as striking similarity.\n\nWhen it comes to *Kimi to Kanojo to Kanojo no Koi.*(The Love Between You, Her, and Her, abbreviated *Totono*), a visual game published by Nitroplus, I'm more inclined to say DDLC is imitating it, since they bear the same core idea: the heroine(a female character with her own route) being the literal \"game changer\", while still inside of it. Although to be exact, Monika doesn't own a route.\n\nMiyuki Sone is a childhood friend of Shinichi, our protagonist, and she's also an idol in the school. One can always refer to the game for further details. The point is, first the player is limited to Miyuki's route, and then, when the player goes down the route of another heroine -- Aoi -- in its end Miyuki appears, killing Aoi and says the player should be loyal to her and choose her route again and again since the player chose her route in the beginning(yes, she's aware she is a heroine in a visual novel), before killing Shinichi as well.\n\nAfter restarting the game, Miyuki has already changed it, rendering it impossible to choose someone other than Miyuki, in the game. So as one may expect, to save the game from this mire, the player needs something out of the game.\n\nTo solve it, player needs to call a number that comes with the game package. And the very trick dates back to 1998, when the first Metal Gear Solid game was released, wherein Snake needs to contact Meryl, whose codec frequency is on the CD case. Not a CD in the game, but the CD of the game(it's on PS1, so no DVD or blu-ray, just to clarify).\n\nBy the way, only one of the two heroines can be chosen ultimately, and the consequence is irrevertible unless a reinstallation is done. Yeah, one shot.\n\n## (Non-)verdict\n\nAdmittedly, Totono comes first, but its influence is limited. Not only because it's Japanese only, but it's still a galgame, deep in its core. There are H scenes, the plot mainly talks about the relationship, so on and so forth. However, DDLC is an indie game, its lack of commercial spirit makes a wilder attempt a possibility. The developers don't care about whether the girls are that appealing, so they can make the girls depressed or abused, mask their eyes with black pixels, let Monika talk about anything in Act 3, leave a bad end only(with a compromised good one). DDLC is special in this sense. And it's what makes the game appealing, aside from the plot twist. \n\nLike, I would say Monika's Writing Tips of the day are sometimes very inspiring(despite the fourth-wall breaking ones). Those are unforgettable.\n\nSo let's end it with Monika's last tip of the day:\n\n{% quote %}\n\nSometimes when I talk to people who are impressed by my writing, they say things like 'I could never do that'.\n\nIt's really depressing, you know?\n\nAs someone who loves more than anything else to share the joy of exploring your passions...\n\n...it pains me when people think that being good just comes naturally.\n\nThat's how it is with everything, not just writing.\n\nWhen you try something for the first time, you're probably going to suck at it.\n\nSometimes, when you finish, you feel really proud of it and even want to share it with everyone.\n\nBut maybe after a few weeks you come back to it, and you realize it was never really any good.\n\nThat happens to me all the time.\n\nIt can be pretty disheartening to put so much time and effort into something, and then you realize it sucks.\n\nBut that tends to happen when you're always comparing yourself to the top professionals.\n\nWhen you reach right for the stars, they're always gonna be out of your reach, you know?\n\nThe truth is, you have to climb up there, step by step.\n\nAnd whenever you reach a milestone, first you look back and see how far you've gotten...\n\nAnd then you look ahead and realize how much more there is to go.\n\nSo, sometimes it can help to set the bar a little lower...\n\nTry to find something you think is pretty good, but not world-class.\n\nAnd you can make that your own personal goal.\n\nIt's also really important to understand the scope of what you're trying to do.\n\nIf you jump right into a huge project and you're still amateur, you'll never get it done.\n\nSo if we're talking about writing, a novel might be too much at first.\n\nWhy not try some short stories?\n\nThe great thing about short stories is that you can focus on just one thing that you want to do right.\n\nThat goes for small projects in general -- you can really focus on the one or two things.\n\nIt's such a good learning experience and stepping stone.\n\nOh, one more thing...\n\nWriting isn't something where you just reach into your heart and something beautiful comes out.\n\nJust like drawing and painting, it's a skill in itself to learn how to express what you have inside.\n\nThat means there are methods and guides and basics to it!\n\nReading up on that stuff can be super eye-opening.\n\nThat sort of planning and organization will really help prevent you from getting overwhelmed and giving up.\n\nAnd before you know it...\n\nYou start sucking less and less.\n\nNothing comes naturally.\n\nOur society, our art, everything -- it's built on thousands of years of human innovation.\n\nSo as long as you start on that foundation, and take it step by step...\n\nYou, too, can do amazing things.\n\n...That's my advice for today!\n\nThanks for listening~\n\n{% endquote %}\n","source":"_posts/ddlc.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Let's start from DDLC\ntags:\n  - literature\n  - game\n  - meta\n  - timeleap\nlang: en\ncategory:\n  - writing\ndate: 2018-1-26 03:05:51\nlabel: ddlc review\n---\n\n\n{% alert warning %}\nThis article contains spoilers, which may harm or even completely ruin your playing experience of the games, including but not limited to:\n*Doki Doki Literature Club!*\n\nProceed at your own risk.\n{% endalert %}\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n[Doki Doki Literature Club!](http://ddlc.moe)(DDLC) is a free game that has made to Steam around Oct. Despite being a visual novel, a genre which only a minority would enjoy because of its lack of playability, the game received positive critical reviews, scoring a 97% in its over 40k reviews(as of Dec 18, 2017), which is a feat given the reviews are from a larger group of players, rather than a small bunch of loyal fans(like *Megadimension Neptunia*, it has a 98% positive, but only out of 1.6k reviews).\n\nSo let's dig into it a little bit.\n\nAs a galgame(at least it looks like one), DDLC features four cute schoolgirls: Sayori, the outgoing childhood friend, and vice president of the club; Natsuki, a tiny figure who likes baking and watching manga; Yuri, a composed schoolgirl who behaves with maturity; and Monika, president of the club, who is lively and thoughtful. Your goal is to have a great festival with them, and finally, get one of the girl's heart, as the [store page](http://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/) suggests. The story is set in a highschool, so all of the four girls are (probably) underaged, Valve's inhumane censorship makes publishing a erotic game on Steam pratically a impossibility, but there are still ways, out of Steam.\n\nAt least that's what everybody expected on seeing its download page. Though it says that the game is not for those who are easily disturbed, maybe it's just too disturbing in a *sexual* sense. You know, sexy, nudity, common traits of these galgames. Even a [game calling itself R18](http://store.steampowered.com/app/416130/) can make its way onto Steam(but it's garbage, like some other censored games), so one may assume that Valve is sometimes lenient to these things, which is never the case. Even an all-aged game, [Ie no Kagi](http://ugainovel.web.fc2.com/ienoKagi/), [was deleted by Valve in suspect of pedophilia](https://steamcommunity.com/app/710370/discussions/0/1499000547482233373/). So some just cut it off, like what they do to a minigame in Mugen Souls, which doesn't hurt much. But for some others where it's an important part, while the games on Steam are PG, have R18 patches distributed, for free(like those sakura games) or with a price(sold on Denpasoft). So such ecchi elements(*oiroke youso* in Japanese) is not that unacceptable, but rather, welcome for me.\n\nBut it turns out not to be the case for DDLC. Quite the opposite. After witnessing Nekopara's **first person shooter** tag, someone might think it's another joke upon the first sight of the tags of DDLC. However, this time there's no joke. DDLC, as the tag **psychological horror** suggests, is actually a story full of scares, revealing a darker side of personality. The same tag for *Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy*, on the other hand, is only a funny reference to the game's extraordinary difficulty.\n\n## Doki-doki school life\n\nThe game begins with a cliche VN plot, the main protagonist(the player names him), on an invitation from his childhood friend, Sayori, decides to actually pay a visit to the club she's in -- the literature club. There he meets the other three girls in the club: Natsuki making cupcakes for everyone, Yuri bringing him a book to read and at last, president Monika, regarding the iminnent school festival, proposes that everyone writes a poem, and brings it the second day to share with each other to enhance mutual communication and writing skills.\n\nAnd here comes the game's main mechanism. To compose a poem, you need to have 20 words, each of them chosen from 10 words. Every word appeals most to a specific heroine, and the hint is given during the day: Yuri loves something abstract and metaphorical, while cute words like lollipop or kawaii are appealing to Natsuki. And about Sayori, she have an inclination towards human emotion, and is drawn to both words for happiness and ones for sadness, which is made clear in the second day. The girl's storyline will progress who is the most pleased. There are stickers of the girls showing on the left while making a poem. When a word is chosen, the corresponding girl will jump, making an easy indicator.\n\nThe girls react differently to the poems, as one may suppose. That is, if you write a poem that attracts Sayori most, for Natsuki it will be tepid. And if you write a \"Yuri\" poem on the second day, after Natsuki and Yuri had a quarrel about writing style, Natsuki may even feel sorry for that she has insulted the style of both Yuri and the MC, and runs away. Of course, as a part of the sharing, you will read the poems written by the four girls, and they are mostly identical to their word preference.\n\nThe true nature of the game is hidden till now, but clues are given here and there. Monika's Writing Tips on the second day is a fourth-wall breaking one: save the game when you're doing an important decision. On the third day, Sayori becomes a bit off, and she's written a poem, which is really creepy according to the MC: \n{% blockquote Sayori, Bottle%}\nThey were supposed to be for my friends, my friends who aren't smiling.\nThey're all shouting, pleading. Something.\nBut all I hear is echo, echo, echo, echo, echo\nInside my head\n{% endblockquote %}\n\nThe poem managed to take a toll on my sanity. And Yuri's poem today seems a mite uncanny as well. It tells a story of 'I' and a raccoon. 'I' feed the raccoon with bread crumbs every day, and as a result the raccoon grows excitement when 'I' show the very knife used for cutting bread. In the end of the poem:\n{% blockquote Yuri, The Raccoon %}\nA rush of blood. Classic Pavlovian conditioning. I slice the bread.\nAnd I feed myself again.\n{% endblockquote %}\n\nBut to my relief, Yuri seems to be normal, yes, normal, after all, for now. You can even witness her cuteness if you choose to help her out on the fourth day. And she's like cuuuuuuuuteeeeeeee, the embarassment after her licking <del>your</del> main protagonist's hurt finger is good. I don't really think that way. I'm just pretending to be innocent. Unconscious finger licking is just too archetypal for an anime girl, because it can show the girl's other side of loveliness, in spite of how elegant and composed she might usually be.\n\nSo I just root for Natsuki for the weekend event. In this case, <del>you</del> the MC does a *Kabedon* on Natsuki, but still, the conversations are not as romantic or passionate as one may expect. Everyday stuff with a little teasing, and that's it. It kind of fits my ideal of a good relationship between a boy and a girl, something of Platonic love. I'm not debasing sexual relationship, but pure love is, to me, more precious given the prevalence of the prior one. Cause Sayori is helping out Monika, you cannot choose to help either of them.\n\nBack to this morning. The welcomed protag decides to visit Sayori before Natsuki/Yuri's arrival. Sayori reveals that she suffers from heavy depression, and hope that the he just forget about her and get along with other girls. But she also admits her feeling heartbroken seeing his having a good time with them, without actually realizing that it's out of jealousy. Sayori shows up again, and after Natsuki/Yuri is gone, she confesses her love for our protagonist. Here you have two options: accept it or not. If you choose to accept it, the two of them hugs each other and on and on. If not, Sayori breaks down, with a cry she runs away.\n\nI'm glad I choosed to confess the love in my first run. Hope I've brought her some \"hxppy thxughts\"[1](#happy-thoughts).\n\nEither way, on the day of the festival, you'll see her last poem on the literature club's pamphlet. Named *%*, it's dark and well, a lot creepier than her second poem. \n\n{% blockquote Sayori, % %}\n<span style=\"white-space:nowrap;margin:auto -100% auto auto;margin:auto calc(50% - 50vw) auto auto;\">Get out of my head.

It's a part of the poet themself, whether about their feelings or experiences. In this sense, all poems written by the same people are in fact a continuous flow of the poet's personal experiences. So a poem can never be finished in this way, it's just like some underground rivers, some streams seemingly seperated by rocks are in fact connected together. And if this flow just stops moving...think you get the point.\n\nThe poem reminds one of everything. Of her creepy one on the third day, of her leave on Friday, of her telling you she's suffering from heavy depression in the weekend.\n\nNo, it can't be. I keep assuring myself. It's just a mediocre visual novel, only appealing to those weebs who can't even stand a non-virgin, easily afraid theres no way Sayori will do something she's fine just a little depression wont do anything shes fine shes fine shes fine she must be fine god she must be fine\n\nBut that feeling can't go away.\n\nThe screen turns black after you enter Sayori's house. When it goes bright again, Sayori is there.\n\nHer body is there.\n\nAnd everything speeds from bad to worse henceforth. The game restarts, but this time without Sayori. Her sprite in the title screen is replaced by an amalgam of the other members' pixels. All previous saves become unloadable(saying you cannot find Sayori's character file) and then deleted. Then the story unrolls as if Sayori never existed.\n\nNow the game have glitches here and there, and things are exacerbating for Natsuki and Yuri. They have a quarrel on the same day as before, but without Sayori this time, it remains unchecked. \n\nIf you've triggered Natsuki's event this day, she'll faint while talking to the protagonist, which, by Monika, is due to her malnutrition. And Natsuki hints that she's suffering from home abuse. When it comes to Yuri, she begins to show somewhat excessive obsession with MC. It's like the first run, but the world is falling apart.\n\nFear of the unknown may be a little more fundamental than other phobias. One is constantly scared, because what comes next is beyond imagination.\n\nIt's said that prepare for the worst. Ironically, sometimes the same thing applies to our fear, too. The worst thought pops in our mind, usually when it's most unwanted. Horror games try to exploit this. They don't scare you all the time, instead they create a ghastly environment, and the player's mind will do the rest.\n\nBut DDLC is not entirely getting at it. Though Salvato, its creater, decided to make something eerie with a sugar coat, there's something, other than pure horror in the game. Without it, DDLC would be a lot less special.\n\nThat's meta. Sometimes I find my self unable to resist the charm of those self references and fourth-wall breaking stuff.\n\n## Beyond the topsy-turvy\n\n{% alert danger %}\nYou've come a long way here, which means about half the plot has been spoiled already. No turning back if you go on reading.\nIf you do have some interest, why not stop here and play the game right away? It's free and takes just a couple of hours to go through, definitely worth a try.\n\nAnd unfortunately, some other innocent games will be spoiled just because they bear some relevance. Amen.\n\nThe names of the games aren't listed here in case of being a spoiler.\n\n{% endalert %}\n\nFrom its greek definition, a metagame should be a game about games, or a game beyond games. \n\nIt's nothing new. After all, Shakespeare wrote meta-dramas centuries ago. You can make a game about making games, just like what lightnovel writers have been doing recently. Shion Momone, Masamune Izumi, Hashima Itsuki, all of them. The author of *Noucome* is working on a new one in this genre, too, and the first volume is interesting.\n\nSega, near its end of life in the console war, made a game called *Segagaga*. In this game the player assumes Taro Sega, trying to save Sega by making a great game ,beating the rivaling company DOGMA (a parody of Sony, one of its main competitors back then), and capture as much market share as possible. Ironic jokes and parodies throughout the play make the game a mite different. But it cannot compare to the *Seaman*, another game published by Sega, in the sense of weirdness. In the game, the player brings up and interact with a man-faced fish.\n\nAnd the eccentricity also exists in the first parts of DDLC.\n\nWithout Sayori, one can say the first act is just about ordinary school life, and in the second act, a horrible one. It’s like Danganronpa, where there’s a chapter of (un)common life and then another about class trial.\n\n---\n\nMonika \nMonika\nMonika shows up, and upon entering the classroom, she realizes that she has screwed it all. So she deletes Yuri and Natsuki’s character file and cleans up the mess. And it’s progressing on to Act 3.\n\nThe game restarts again, and this time, <del>the protagonist</del>the player sits with Monika, face to face. But unlike other girls, Monika face right to the screen in the whole gameplay, so it’s always the case.\n\nMøn ka admits that she’s the culprit of all the terrible school life, however, it’s due to her obssession with the player, the only reality in the world of fiction.\n\nAll of a sudden, M̶o̶n̶ìką realized all the other members of the literature club were nothing but a piece of code, and their characters were just some archetypes common in Japanese anime, game and stuff. Frantically wanting to be together with the player, she abuses her privilege as the president, forces the player to choose to help her at the weekend, and even interferes with the personality of other girls. \n\nAt the price of the game itself.\n\nBut deleting the character file of others, and even telling how to do it to the player, who she believes would never betray her, turn out to be her undoings. In this act M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a will talk about some random topics, and some of them are thought provoking. The eternity lasts, until the player deletes her character file.\n\nBeing removed leads to Monika reflecting on herself about what she's done to Sayori, Natsuki, Yuri, and also, the player. She apologizes for ruining the player's experience as I'm now doing, and admits though fictitious, they're still her friends. So she decides to restore the world to its initial state. A world the player desires. And a world without Monika.\n\nEverything seems on track at first. Sayori thanks the player for making the other girls happy, and...\n\nAnd for getting rid of Monika. As the new president of the literature club, Sayori has obtained the ability that is once Monika's. Trying to use it to be with the player forever, Sayori is stopped short by Monika. In the end, Monika says, the Literature Club is no more than a place of grief and despair, so she decides to disband it. \n\nThen Monika plays her song Your Reality(she picked up the piano for it), while the graphics are displayed. They are removed in the end, along with the game files.\n\n{% quote %}\nIf I don't know how to love you\nI'll leave you be\n{% endquote %}\n\nFrom here on, the game won't start. Instead, a farewell message from Monika is displayed.\n\nIf all CGs are seen, there's an alternative end, where Sayori and the developer thank you and that's it. That marks the end of the game.\n\nSo in its essence, DDLC is a VN, or it tries to be one, but ended up being a melting pot of love, horror, and meta. Though, DDLC isn't the first one to do that. The first with file manipulation in mind may be the computer tutorials. Also, years ago, there's a game called [OneShot](http://store.steampowered.com/app/420530/OneShot/) that used similar tricks.\n\nIn this game, the sun died out, which has been providing energy to the world. And our protagonist, Niko, wakes up with a lightbulb in hand. They know from the prophet the lightbulb is the new sun, and Niko, the savior. Player's goal is to guide Niko to the tower and put the new sun into its place.\n\nBut it's not that simple as it seems. During the pilgrimage, some puzzles requires the player to find something on the computer, instead of from inside the game. Yes, at a time the game places some files in your document directory for you to solve the problems in game. And in another situation, it even resets your desktop background for hints. And the ways to solve them, sometimes, also feature the same technique: you may need to drag the game window to reveal the hidden information, or, close it to progress to the next scene.\n\nIn the last part of the journey, the player comes to know that the sun needs the savior to operate, that is, if Niko returns the sun to the world, they cannot return to their own home. And if Niko smash the lightbulb, they can return, but at the expense of this world.\n\nAnd it's decisive. If Niko sacrifices themself for everybody's sake, when you restart the game, only the starting room is shown, bathed in light, without Niko's presence. If you choose the other route, Niko goes back to their home, but the game will fail to start due to the world's destruction.\n\n{% quote %}\nYou only have one shot.\n{% endquote %}\n\nDon't know how they managed this in the remake version, but in the original version, the registry of the computer is modified to maintain the state across installations. Games becomes scrupulous when they become commercial(and when they go on Steam), so it may not dare to play with the registry now.\n\nHowever unsurprisingly, OneShot closes itself in a non-oneshot way. That's in the solstice update. In this route, things become clear that the world has come to its end already, and the current one is none but a clone, a piece of code running on Player's machine. But the Entity, the mind of the game itself, is \"untamed\"(you can interpret it as insensible), and started to self-destruct in order to protect the innocent victim trapped in the game, that is Niko. Now Niko needs to face the Entity to save the virtual world, and, to return home.\n\nAt a time you even need to move character files into a folder to transport their figures in the game! Only computer tutorials can force one to do that! Maybe the puzzle of deleting a character file comes out of here, we just don't know. Let's just state it as striking similarity.\n\nWhen it comes to *Kimi to Kanojo to Kanojo no Koi.*(The Love Between You, Her, and Her, abbreviated *Totono*), a visual game published by Nitroplus, I'm more inclined to say DDLC is imitating it, since they bear the same core idea: the heroine(a female character with her own route) being the literal \"game changer\", while still inside of it. Although to be exact, Monika doesn't own a route.\n\nMiyuki Sone is a childhood friend of Shinichi, our protagonist, and she's also an idol in the school. One can always refer to the game for further details. The point is, first the player is limited to Miyuki's route, and then, when the player goes down the route of another heroine -- Aoi -- in its end Miyuki appears, killing Aoi and says the player should be loyal to her and choose her route again and again since the player chose her route in the beginning(yes, she's aware she is a heroine in a visual novel), before killing Shinichi as well.\n\nAfter restarting the game, Miyuki has already changed it, rendering it impossible to choose someone other than Miyuki, in the game. So as one may expect, to save the game from this mire, the player needs something out of the game.\n\nTo solve it, player needs to call a number that comes with the game package. And the very trick dates back to 1998, when the first Metal Gear Solid game was released, wherein Snake needs to contact Meryl, whose codec frequency is on the CD case. Not a CD in the game, but the CD of the game(it's on PS1, so no DVD or blu-ray, just to clarify).\n\nBy the way, only one of the two heroines can be chosen ultimately, and the consequence is irrevertible unless a reinstallation is done. Yeah, one shot.\n\n## (Non-)verdict\n\nAdmittedly, Totono comes first, but its influence is limited. Not only because it's Japanese only, but it's still a galgame, deep in its core. There are H scenes, the plot mainly talks about the relationship, so on and so forth. However, DDLC is an indie game, its lack of commercial spirit makes a wilder attempt a possibility. The developers don't care about whether the girls are that appealing, so they can make the girls depressed or abused, mask their eyes with black pixels, let Monika talk about anything in Act 3, leave a bad end only(with a compromised good one). DDLC is special in this sense. And it's what makes the game appealing, aside from the plot twist. \n\nLike, I would say Monika's Writing Tips of the day are sometimes very inspiring(despite the fourth-wall breaking ones). Those are unforgettable.\n\nSo let's end it with Monika's last tip of the day:\n\n{% quote %}\n\nSometimes when I talk to people who are impressed by my writing, they say things like 'I could never do that'.\n\nIt's really depressing, you know?\n\nAs someone who loves more than anything else to share the joy of exploring your passions...\n\n...it pains me when people think that being good just comes naturally.\n\nThat's how it is with everything, not just writing.\n\nWhen you try something for the first time, you're probably going to suck at it.\n\nSometimes, when you finish, you feel really proud of it and even want to share it with everyone.\n\nBut maybe after a few weeks you come back to it, and you realize it was never really any good.\n\nThat happens to me all the time.\n\nIt can be pretty disheartening to put so much time and effort into something, and then you realize it sucks.\n\nBut that tends to happen when you're always comparing yourself to the top professionals.\n\nWhen you reach right for the stars, they're always gonna be out of your reach, you know?\n\nThe truth is, you have to climb up there, step by step.\n\nAnd whenever you reach a milestone, first you look back and see how far you've gotten...\n\nAnd then you look ahead and realize how much more there is to go.\n\nSo, sometimes it can help to set the bar a little lower...\n\nTry to find something you think is pretty good, but not world-class.\n\nAnd you can make that your own personal goal.\n\nIt's also really important to understand the scope of what you're trying to do.\n\nIf you jump right into a huge project and you're still amateur, you'll never get it done.\n\nSo if we're talking about writing, a novel might be too much at first.\n\nWhy not try some short stories?\n\nThe great thing about short stories is that you can focus on just one thing that you want to do right.\n\nThat goes for small projects in general -- you can really focus on the one or two things.\n\nIt's such a good learning experience and stepping stone.\n\nOh, one more thing...\n\nWriting isn't something where you just reach into your heart and something beautiful comes out.\n\nJust like drawing and painting, it's a skill in itself to learn how to express what you have inside.\n\nThat means there are methods and guides and basics to it!\n\nReading up on that stuff can be super eye-opening.\n\nThat sort of planning and organization will really help prevent you from getting overwhelmed and giving up.\n\nAnd before you know it...\n\nYou start sucking less and less.\n\nNothing comes naturally.\n\nOur society, our art, everything -- it's built on thousands of years of human innovation.\n\nSo as long as you start on that foundation, and take it step by step...\n\nYou, too, can do amazing things.\n\n...That's my advice for today!\n\nThanks for listening~\n\n{% endquote %}\n","slug":"ddlc","published":1,"updated":"2020-04-01T07:12:23.055Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"ck8h06r5w0014bfvi9tqxcuvf","content":"<div class=\"alert warning\"><p>This article contains spoilers, which may harm or even completely ruin your playing experience of the games, including but not limited to:\n<em>Doki Doki Literature Club!</em></p>\n<p>Proceed at your own risk.</p>\n</div>\n<a id=\"more\"></a>\n<p><a href=\"http://ddlc.moe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Doki Doki Literature Club!</a>(DDLC) is a free game that has made to Steam around Oct. Despite being a visual novel, a genre which only a minority would enjoy because of its lack of playability, the game received positive critical reviews, scoring a 97% in its over 40k reviews(as of Dec 18, 2017), which is a feat given the reviews are from a larger group of players, rather than a small bunch of loyal fans(like <em>Megadimension Neptunia</em>, it has a 98% positive, but only out of 1.6k reviews).</p>\n<p>So let’s dig into it a little bit.</p>\n<p>As a galgame(at least it looks like one), DDLC features four cute schoolgirls: Sayori, the outgoing childhood friend, and vice president of the club; Natsuki, a tiny figure who likes baking and watching manga; Yuri, a composed schoolgirl who behaves with maturity; and Monika, president of the club, who is lively and thoughtful. Your goal is to have a great festival with them, and finally, get one of the girl’s heart, as the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">store page</a> suggests. The story is set in a highschool, so all of the four girls are (probably) underaged, Valve’s inhumane censorship makes publishing a erotic game on Steam pratically a impossibility, but there are still ways, out of Steam.</p>\n<p>At least that’s what everybody expected on seeing its download page. Though it says that the game is not for those who are easily disturbed, maybe it’s just too disturbing in a <em>sexual</em> sense. You know, sexy, nudity, common traits of these galgames. Even a <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/416130/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">game calling itself R18</a> can make its way onto Steam(but it’s garbage, like some other censored games), so one may assume that Valve is sometimes lenient to these things, which is never the case. Even an all-aged game, <a href=\"http://ugainovel.web.fc2.com/ienoKagi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ie no Kagi</a>, <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/app/710370/discussions/0/1499000547482233373/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was deleted by Valve in suspect of pedophilia</a>. So some just cut it off, like what they do to a minigame in Mugen Souls, which doesn’t hurt much. But for some others where it’s an important part, while the games on Steam are PG, have R18 patches distributed, for free(like those sakura games) or with a price(sold on Denpasoft). So such ecchi elements(<em>oiroke youso</em> in Japanese) is not that unacceptable, but rather, welcome for me.</p>\n<p>But it turns out not to be the case for DDLC. Quite the opposite. After witnessing Nekopara’s <strong>first person shooter</strong> tag, someone might think it’s another joke upon the first sight of the tags of DDLC. However, this time there’s no joke. DDLC, as the tag <strong>psychological horror</strong> suggests, is actually a story full of scares, revealing a darker side of personality. The same tag for <em>Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy</em>, on the other hand, is only a funny reference to the game’s extraordinary difficulty.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Doki-doki-school-life\">Doki-doki school life</h2>\n<p>The game begins with a cliche VN plot, the main protagonist(the player names him), on an invitation from his childhood friend, Sayori, decides to actually pay a visit to the club she’s in – the literature club. There he meets the other three girls in the club: Natsuki making cupcakes for everyone, Yuri bringing him a book to read and at last, president Monika, regarding the iminnent school festival, proposes that everyone writes a poem, and brings it the second day to share with each other to enhance mutual communication and writing skills.</p>\n<p>And here comes the game’s main mechanism. To compose a poem, you need to have 20 words, each of them chosen from 10 words. Every word appeals most to a specific heroine, and the hint is given during the day: Yuri loves something abstract and metaphorical, while cute words like lollipop or kawaii are appealing to Natsuki. And about Sayori, she have an inclination towards human emotion, and is drawn to both words for happiness and ones for sadness, which is made clear in the second day. The girl’s storyline will progress who is the most pleased. There are stickers of the girls showing on the left while making a poem. When a word is chosen, the corresponding girl will jump, making an easy indicator.</p>\n<p>The girls react differently to the poems, as one may suppose. That is, if you write a poem that attracts Sayori most, for Natsuki it will be tepid. And if you write a “Yuri” poem on the second day, after Natsuki and Yuri had a quarrel about writing style, Natsuki may even feel sorry for that she has insulted the style of both Yuri and the MC, and runs away. Of course, as a part of the sharing, you will read the poems written by the four girls, and they are mostly identical to their word preference.</p>\n<p>The true nature of the game is hidden till now, but clues are given here and there. Monika’s Writing Tips on the second day is a fourth-wall breaking one: save the game when you’re doing an important decision. On the third day, Sayori becomes a bit off, and she’s written a poem, which is really creepy according to the MC:</p>\n<blockquote><p>They were supposed to be for my friends, my friends who aren’t smiling.\nThey’re all shouting, pleading. Something.\nBut all I hear is echo, echo, echo, echo, echo\nInside my head</p>\n<footer><strong>Sayori</strong><cite>Bottle</cite></footer></blockquote>\n<p>The poem managed to take a toll on my sanity. And Yuri’s poem today seems a mite uncanny as well. It tells a story of ‘I’ and a raccoon. ‘I’ feed the raccoon with bread crumbs every day, and as a result the raccoon grows excitement when ‘I’ show the very knife used for cutting bread. In the end of the poem:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A rush of blood. Classic Pavlovian conditioning. I slice the bread.\nAnd I feed myself again.</p>\n<footer><strong>Yuri</strong><cite>The Raccoon</cite></footer></blockquote>\n<p>But to my relief, Yuri seems to be normal, yes, normal, after all, for now. You can even witness her cuteness if you choose to help her out on the fourth day. And she’s like cuuuuuuuuteeeeeeee, the embarassment after her licking <del>your</del> main protagonist’s hurt finger is good. I don’t really think that way. I’m just pretending to be innocent. Unconscious finger licking is just too archetypal for an anime girl, because it can show the girl’s other side of loveliness, in spite of how elegant and composed she might usually be.</p>\n<p>So I just root for Natsuki for the weekend event. In this case, <del>you</del> the MC does a <em>Kabedon</em> on Natsuki, but still, the conversations are not as romantic or passionate as one may expect. Everyday stuff with a little teasing, and that’s it. It kind of fits my ideal of a good relationship between a boy and a girl, something of Platonic love. I’m not debasing sexual relationship, but pure love is, to me, more precious given the prevalence of the prior one. Cause Sayori is helping out Monika, you cannot choose to help either of them.</p>\n<p>Back to this morning. The welcomed protag decides to visit Sayori before Natsuki/Yuri’s arrival. Sayori reveals that she suffers from heavy depression, and hope that the he just forget about her and get along with other girls. But she also admits her feeling heartbroken seeing his having a good time with them, without actually realizing that it’s out of jealousy. Sayori shows up again, and after Natsuki/Yuri is gone, she confesses her love for our protagonist. Here you have two options: accept it or not. If you choose to accept it, the two of them hugs each other and on and on. If not, Sayori breaks down, with a cry she runs away.</p>\n<p>I’m glad I choosed to confess the love in my first run. Hope I’ve brought her some &quot;hxppy thxughts&quot;<a href=\"#happy-thoughts\">1</a>.</p>\n<p>Either way, on the day of the festival, you’ll see her last poem on the literature club’s pamphlet. Named <em>%</em>, it’s dark and well, a lot creepier than her second poem.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"white-space:nowrap;margin:auto -100% auto auto;margin:auto calc(50% - 50vw) auto auto;\">Get out of my head.

It’s a part of the poet themself, whether about their feelings or experiences. In this sense, all poems written by the same people are in fact a continuous flow of the poet’s personal experiences. So a poem can never be finished in this way, it’s just like some underground rivers, some streams seemingly seperated by rocks are in fact connected together. And if this flow just stops moving…think you get the point.</p>\n<p>The poem reminds one of everything. Of her creepy one on the third day, of her leave on Friday, of her telling you she’s suffering from heavy depression in the weekend.</p>\n<p>No, it can’t be. I keep assuring myself. It’s just a mediocre visual novel, only appealing to those weebs who can’t even stand a non-virgin, easily afraid theres no way Sayori will do something she’s fine just a little depression wont do anything shes fine shes fine shes fine she must be fine god she must be fine</p>\n<p>But that feeling can’t go away.</p>\n<p>The screen turns black after you enter Sayori’s house. When it goes bright again, Sayori is there.</p>\n<p>Her body is there.</p>\n<p>And everything speeds from bad to worse henceforth. The game restarts, but this time without Sayori. Her sprite in the title screen is replaced by an amalgam of the other members’ pixels. All previous saves become unloadable(saying you cannot find Sayori’s character file) and then deleted. Then the story unrolls as if Sayori never existed.</p>\n<p>Now the game have glitches here and there, and things are exacerbating for Natsuki and Yuri. They have a quarrel on the same day as before, but without Sayori this time, it remains unchecked.</p>\n<p>If you’ve triggered Natsuki’s event this day, she’ll faint while talking to the protagonist, which, by Monika, is due to her malnutrition. And Natsuki hints that she’s suffering from home abuse. When it comes to Yuri, she begins to show somewhat excessive obsession with MC. It’s like the first run, but the world is falling apart.</p>\n<p>Fear of the unknown may be a little more fundamental than other phobias. One is constantly scared, because what comes next is beyond imagination.</p>\n<p>It’s said that prepare for the worst. Ironically, sometimes the same thing applies to our fear, too. The worst thought pops in our mind, usually when it’s most unwanted. Horror games try to exploit this. They don’t scare you all the time, instead they create a ghastly environment, and the player’s mind will do the rest.</p>\n<p>But DDLC is not entirely getting at it. Though Salvato, its creater, decided to make something eerie with a sugar coat, there’s something, other than pure horror in the game. Without it, DDLC would be a lot less special.</p>\n<p>That’s meta. Sometimes I find my self unable to resist the charm of those self references and fourth-wall breaking stuff.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Beyond-the-topsy-turvy\">Beyond the topsy-turvy</h2>\n<div class=\"alert danger\"><p>You’ve come a long way here, which means about half the plot has been spoiled already. No turning back if you go on reading.\nIf you do have some interest, why not stop here and play the game right away? It’s free and takes just a couple of hours to go through, definitely worth a try.</p>\n<p>And unfortunately, some other innocent games will be spoiled just because they bear some relevance. Amen.</p>\n<p>The names of the games aren’t listed here in case of being a spoiler.</p>\n</div>\n<p>From its greek definition, a metagame should be a game about games, or a game beyond games.</p>\n<p>It’s nothing new. After all, Shakespeare wrote meta-dramas centuries ago. You can make a game about making games, just like what lightnovel writers have been doing recently. Shion Momone, Masamune Izumi, Hashima Itsuki, all of them. The author of <em>Noucome</em> is working on a new one in this genre, too, and the first volume is interesting.</p>\n<p>Sega, near its end of life in the console war, made a game called <em>Segagaga</em>. In this game the player assumes Taro Sega, trying to save Sega by making a great game ,beating the rivaling company DOGMA (a parody of Sony, one of its main competitors back then), and capture as much market share as possible. Ironic jokes and parodies throughout the play make the game a mite different. But it cannot compare to the <em>Seaman</em>, another game published by Sega, in the sense of weirdness. In the game, the player brings up and interact with a man-faced fish.</p>\n<p>And the eccentricity also exists in the first parts of DDLC.</p>\n<p>Without Sayori, one can say the first act is just about ordinary school life, and in the second act, a horrible one. It’s like Danganronpa, where there’s a chapter of (un)common life and then another about class trial.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Monika\nMonika\nMonika shows up, and upon entering the classroom, she realizes that she has screwed it all. So she deletes Yuri and Natsuki’s character file and cleans up the mess. And it’s progressing on to Act 3.</p>\n<p>The game restarts again, and this time, <del>the protagonist</del>the player sits with Monika, face to face. But unlike other girls, Monika face right to the screen in the whole gameplay, so it’s always the case.</p>\n<p>Møn ka admits that she’s the culprit of all the terrible school life, however, it’s due to her obssession with the player, the only reality in the world of fiction.</p>\n<p>All of a sudden, M̶o̶n̶ìką realized all the other members of the literature club were nothing but a piece of code, and their characters were just some archetypes common in Japanese anime, game and stuff. Frantically wanting to be together with the player, she abuses her privilege as the president, forces the player to choose to help her at the weekend, and even interferes with the personality of other girls.</p>\n<p>At the price of the game itself.</p>\n<p>But deleting the character file of others, and even telling how to do it to the player, who she believes would never betray her, turn out to be her undoings. In this act M    a will talk about some random topics, and some of them are thought provoking. The eternity lasts, until the player deletes her character file.</p>\n<p>Being removed leads to Monika reflecting on herself about what she’s done to Sayori, Natsuki, Yuri, and also, the player. She apologizes for ruining the player’s experience as I’m now doing, and admits though fictitious, they’re still her friends. So she decides to restore the world to its initial state. A world the player desires. And a world without Monika.</p>\n<p>Everything seems on track at first. Sayori thanks the player for making the other girls happy, and…</p>\n<p>And for getting rid of Monika. As the new president of the literature club, Sayori has obtained the ability that is once Monika’s. Trying to use it to be with the player forever, Sayori is stopped short by Monika. In the end, Monika says, the Literature Club is no more than a place of grief and despair, so she decides to disband it.</p>\n<p>Then Monika plays her song Your Reality(she picked up the piano for it), while the graphics are displayed. They are removed in the end, along with the game files.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If I don’t know how to love you\nI’ll leave you be</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From here on, the game won’t start. Instead, a farewell message from Monika is displayed.</p>\n<p>If all CGs are seen, there’s an alternative end, where Sayori and the developer thank you and that’s it. That marks the end of the game.</p>\n<p>So in its essence, DDLC is a VN, or it tries to be one, but ended up being a melting pot of love, horror, and meta. Though, DDLC isn’t the first one to do that. The first with file manipulation in mind may be the computer tutorials. Also, years ago, there’s a game called <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/420530/OneShot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OneShot</a> that used similar tricks.</p>\n<p>In this game, the sun died out, which has been providing energy to the world. And our protagonist, Niko, wakes up with a lightbulb in hand. They know from the prophet the lightbulb is the new sun, and Niko, the savior. Player’s goal is to guide Niko to the tower and put the new sun into its place.</p>\n<p>But it’s not that simple as it seems. During the pilgrimage, some puzzles requires the player to find something on the computer, instead of from inside the game. Yes, at a time the game places some files in your document directory for you to solve the problems in game. And in another situation, it even resets your desktop background for hints. And the ways to solve them, sometimes, also feature the same technique: you may need to drag the game window to reveal the hidden information, or, close it to progress to the next scene.</p>\n<p>In the last part of the journey, the player comes to know that the sun needs the savior to operate, that is, if Niko returns the sun to the world, they cannot return to their own home. And if Niko smash the lightbulb, they can return, but at the expense of this world.</p>\n<p>And it’s decisive. If Niko sacrifices themself for everybody’s sake, when you restart the game, only the starting room is shown, bathed in light, without Niko’s presence. If you choose the other route, Niko goes back to their home, but the game will fail to start due to the world’s destruction.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You only have one shot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Don’t know how they managed this in the remake version, but in the original version, the registry of the computer is modified to maintain the state across installations. Games becomes scrupulous when they become commercial(and when they go on Steam), so it may not dare to play with the registry now.</p>\n<p>However unsurprisingly, OneShot closes itself in a non-oneshot way. That’s in the solstice update. In this route, things become clear that the world has come to its end already, and the current one is none but a clone, a piece of code running on Player’s machine. But the Entity, the mind of the game itself, is “untamed”(you can interpret it as insensible), and started to self-destruct in order to protect the innocent victim trapped in the game, that is Niko. Now Niko needs to face the Entity to save the virtual world, and, to return home.</p>\n<p>At a time you even need to move character files into a folder to transport their figures in the game! Only computer tutorials can force one to do that! Maybe the puzzle of deleting a character file comes out of here, we just don’t know. Let’s just state it as striking similarity.</p>\n<p>When it comes to <em>Kimi to Kanojo to Kanojo no Koi.</em>(The Love Between You, Her, and Her, abbreviated <em>Totono</em>), a visual game published by Nitroplus, I’m more inclined to say DDLC is imitating it, since they bear the same core idea: the heroine(a female character with her own route) being the literal “game changer”, while still inside of it. Although to be exact, Monika doesn’t own a route.</p>\n<p>Miyuki Sone is a childhood friend of Shinichi, our protagonist, and she’s also an idol in the school. One can always refer to the game for further details. The point is, first the player is limited to Miyuki’s route, and then, when the player goes down the route of another heroine – Aoi – in its end Miyuki appears, killing Aoi and says the player should be loyal to her and choose her route again and again since the player chose her route in the beginning(yes, she’s aware she is a heroine in a visual novel), before killing Shinichi as well.</p>\n<p>After restarting the game, Miyuki has already changed it, rendering it impossible to choose someone other than Miyuki, in the game. So as one may expect, to save the game from this mire, the player needs something out of the game.</p>\n<p>To solve it, player needs to call a number that comes with the game package. And the very trick dates back to 1998, when the first Metal Gear Solid game was released, wherein Snake needs to contact Meryl, whose codec frequency is on the CD case. Not a CD in the game, but the CD of the game(it’s on PS1, so no DVD or blu-ray, just to clarify).</p>\n<p>By the way, only one of the two heroines can be chosen ultimately, and the consequence is irrevertible unless a reinstallation is done. Yeah, one shot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Non-verdict\">(Non-)verdict</h2>\n<p>Admittedly, Totono comes first, but its influence is limited. Not only because it’s Japanese only, but it’s still a galgame, deep in its core. There are H scenes, the plot mainly talks about the relationship, so on and so forth. However, DDLC is an indie game, its lack of commercial spirit makes a wilder attempt a possibility. The developers don’t care about whether the girls are that appealing, so they can make the girls depressed or abused, mask their eyes with black pixels, let Monika talk about anything in Act 3, leave a bad end only(with a compromised good one). DDLC is special in this sense. And it’s what makes the game appealing, aside from the plot twist.</p>\n<p>Like, I would say Monika’s Writing Tips of the day are sometimes very inspiring(despite the fourth-wall breaking ones). Those are unforgettable.</p>\n<p>So let’s end it with Monika’s last tip of the day:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sometimes when I talk to people who are impressed by my writing, they say things like ‘I could never do that’.</p>\n<p>It’s really depressing, you know?</p>\n<p>As someone who loves more than anything else to share the joy of exploring your passions…</p>\n<p>…it pains me when people think that being good just comes naturally.</p>\n<p>That’s how it is with everything, not just writing.</p>\n<p>When you try something for the first time, you’re probably going to suck at it.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, when you finish, you feel really proud of it and even want to share it with everyone.</p>\n<p>But maybe after a few weeks you come back to it, and you realize it was never really any good.</p>\n<p>That happens to me all the time.</p>\n<p>It can be pretty disheartening to put so much time and effort into something, and then you realize it sucks.</p>\n<p>But that tends to happen when you’re always comparing yourself to the top professionals.</p>\n<p>When you reach right for the stars, they’re always gonna be out of your reach, you know?</p>\n<p>The truth is, you have to climb up there, step by step.</p>\n<p>And whenever you reach a milestone, first you look back and see how far you’ve gotten…</p>\n<p>And then you look ahead and realize how much more there is to go.</p>\n<p>So, sometimes it can help to set the bar a little lower…</p>\n<p>Try to find something you think is pretty good, but not world-class.</p>\n<p>And you can make that your own personal goal.</p>\n<p>It’s also really important to understand the scope of what you’re trying to do.</p>\n<p>If you jump right into a huge project and you’re still amateur, you’ll never get it done.</p>\n<p>So if we’re talking about writing, a novel might be too much at first.</p>\n<p>Why not try some short stories?</p>\n<p>The great thing about short stories is that you can focus on just one thing that you want to do right.</p>\n<p>That goes for small projects in general – you can really focus on the one or two things.</p>\n<p>It’s such a good learning experience and stepping stone.</p>\n<p>Oh, one more thing…</p>\n<p>Writing isn’t something where you just reach into your heart and something beautiful comes out.</p>\n<p>Just like drawing and painting, it’s a skill in itself to learn how to express what you have inside.</p>\n<p>That means there are methods and guides and basics to it!</p>\n<p>Reading up on that stuff can be super eye-opening.</p>\n<p>That sort of planning and organization will really help prevent you from getting overwhelmed and giving up.</p>\n<p>And before you know it…</p>\n<p>You start sucking less and less.</p>\n<p>Nothing comes naturally.</p>\n<p>Our society, our art, everything – it’s built on thousands of years of human innovation.</p>\n<p>So as long as you start on that foundation, and take it step by step…</p>\n<p>You, too, can do amazing things.</p>\n<p>…That’s my advice for today!</p>\n<p>Thanks for listening~</p>\n</blockquote>\n","site":{"data":{"config_en":{"title":"Goddess Unknown","subtitle":null,"description":"Peek into the abyss, to find the way towards light.","author":"NoirGif","feed":{"type":"rss2","path":"rss.xml","limit":20}},"config_zh-cn":{"feed":{"type":"rss2","path":"rss.xml","limit":20}}}},"thumbnailImageUrl":null,"excerpt":"<div class=\"alert warning\"><p>This article contains spoilers, which may harm or even completely ruin your playing experience of the games, including but not limited to:\n<em>Doki Doki Literature Club!</em></p>\n<p>Proceed at your own risk.</p>\n</div>","more":"<p><a href=\"http://ddlc.moe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Doki Doki Literature Club!</a>(DDLC) is a free game that has made to Steam around Oct. Despite being a visual novel, a genre which only a minority would enjoy because of its lack of playability, the game received positive critical reviews, scoring a 97% in its over 40k reviews(as of Dec 18, 2017), which is a feat given the reviews are from a larger group of players, rather than a small bunch of loyal fans(like <em>Megadimension Neptunia</em>, it has a 98% positive, but only out of 1.6k reviews).</p>\n<p>So let’s dig into it a little bit.</p>\n<p>As a galgame(at least it looks like one), DDLC features four cute schoolgirls: Sayori, the outgoing childhood friend, and vice president of the club; Natsuki, a tiny figure who likes baking and watching manga; Yuri, a composed schoolgirl who behaves with maturity; and Monika, president of the club, who is lively and thoughtful. Your goal is to have a great festival with them, and finally, get one of the girl’s heart, as the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">store page</a> suggests. The story is set in a highschool, so all of the four girls are (probably) underaged, Valve’s inhumane censorship makes publishing a erotic game on Steam pratically a impossibility, but there are still ways, out of Steam.</p>\n<p>At least that’s what everybody expected on seeing its download page. Though it says that the game is not for those who are easily disturbed, maybe it’s just too disturbing in a <em>sexual</em> sense. You know, sexy, nudity, common traits of these galgames. Even a <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/416130/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">game calling itself R18</a> can make its way onto Steam(but it’s garbage, like some other censored games), so one may assume that Valve is sometimes lenient to these things, which is never the case. Even an all-aged game, <a href=\"http://ugainovel.web.fc2.com/ienoKagi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ie no Kagi</a>, <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/app/710370/discussions/0/1499000547482233373/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was deleted by Valve in suspect of pedophilia</a>. So some just cut it off, like what they do to a minigame in Mugen Souls, which doesn’t hurt much. But for some others where it’s an important part, while the games on Steam are PG, have R18 patches distributed, for free(like those sakura games) or with a price(sold on Denpasoft). So such ecchi elements(<em>oiroke youso</em> in Japanese) is not that unacceptable, but rather, welcome for me.</p>\n<p>But it turns out not to be the case for DDLC. Quite the opposite. After witnessing Nekopara’s <strong>first person shooter</strong> tag, someone might think it’s another joke upon the first sight of the tags of DDLC. However, this time there’s no joke. DDLC, as the tag <strong>psychological horror</strong> suggests, is actually a story full of scares, revealing a darker side of personality. The same tag for <em>Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy</em>, on the other hand, is only a funny reference to the game’s extraordinary difficulty.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Doki-doki-school-life\">Doki-doki school life</h2>\n<p>The game begins with a cliche VN plot, the main protagonist(the player names him), on an invitation from his childhood friend, Sayori, decides to actually pay a visit to the club she’s in – the literature club. There he meets the other three girls in the club: Natsuki making cupcakes for everyone, Yuri bringing him a book to read and at last, president Monika, regarding the iminnent school festival, proposes that everyone writes a poem, and brings it the second day to share with each other to enhance mutual communication and writing skills.</p>\n<p>And here comes the game’s main mechanism. To compose a poem, you need to have 20 words, each of them chosen from 10 words. Every word appeals most to a specific heroine, and the hint is given during the day: Yuri loves something abstract and metaphorical, while cute words like lollipop or kawaii are appealing to Natsuki. And about Sayori, she have an inclination towards human emotion, and is drawn to both words for happiness and ones for sadness, which is made clear in the second day. The girl’s storyline will progress who is the most pleased. There are stickers of the girls showing on the left while making a poem. When a word is chosen, the corresponding girl will jump, making an easy indicator.</p>\n<p>The girls react differently to the poems, as one may suppose. That is, if you write a poem that attracts Sayori most, for Natsuki it will be tepid. And if you write a “Yuri” poem on the second day, after Natsuki and Yuri had a quarrel about writing style, Natsuki may even feel sorry for that she has insulted the style of both Yuri and the MC, and runs away. Of course, as a part of the sharing, you will read the poems written by the four girls, and they are mostly identical to their word preference.</p>\n<p>The true nature of the game is hidden till now, but clues are given here and there. Monika’s Writing Tips on the second day is a fourth-wall breaking one: save the game when you’re doing an important decision. On the third day, Sayori becomes a bit off, and she’s written a poem, which is really creepy according to the MC:</p>\n<blockquote><p>They were supposed to be for my friends, my friends who aren’t smiling.\nThey’re all shouting, pleading. Something.\nBut all I hear is echo, echo, echo, echo, echo\nInside my head</p>\n<footer><strong>Sayori</strong><cite>Bottle</cite></footer></blockquote>\n<p>The poem managed to take a toll on my sanity. And Yuri’s poem today seems a mite uncanny as well. It tells a story of ‘I’ and a raccoon. ‘I’ feed the raccoon with bread crumbs every day, and as a result the raccoon grows excitement when ‘I’ show the very knife used for cutting bread. In the end of the poem:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A rush of blood. Classic Pavlovian conditioning. I slice the bread.\nAnd I feed myself again.</p>\n<footer><strong>Yuri</strong><cite>The Raccoon</cite></footer></blockquote>\n<p>But to my relief, Yuri seems to be normal, yes, normal, after all, for now. You can even witness her cuteness if you choose to help her out on the fourth day. And she’s like cuuuuuuuuteeeeeeee, the embarassment after her licking <del>your</del> main protagonist’s hurt finger is good. I don’t really think that way. I’m just pretending to be innocent. Unconscious finger licking is just too archetypal for an anime girl, because it can show the girl’s other side of loveliness, in spite of how elegant and composed she might usually be.</p>\n<p>So I just root for Natsuki for the weekend event. In this case, <del>you</del> the MC does a <em>Kabedon</em> on Natsuki, but still, the conversations are not as romantic or passionate as one may expect. Everyday stuff with a little teasing, and that’s it. It kind of fits my ideal of a good relationship between a boy and a girl, something of Platonic love. I’m not debasing sexual relationship, but pure love is, to me, more precious given the prevalence of the prior one. Cause Sayori is helping out Monika, you cannot choose to help either of them.</p>\n<p>Back to this morning. The welcomed protag decides to visit Sayori before Natsuki/Yuri’s arrival. Sayori reveals that she suffers from heavy depression, and hope that the he just forget about her and get along with other girls. But she also admits her feeling heartbroken seeing his having a good time with them, without actually realizing that it’s out of jealousy. Sayori shows up again, and after Natsuki/Yuri is gone, she confesses her love for our protagonist. Here you have two options: accept it or not. If you choose to accept it, the two of them hugs each other and on and on. If not, Sayori breaks down, with a cry she runs away.</p>\n<p>I’m glad I choosed to confess the love in my first run. Hope I’ve brought her some &quot;hxppy thxughts&quot;<a href=\"#happy-thoughts\">1</a>.</p>\n<p>Either way, on the day of the festival, you’ll see her last poem on the literature club’s pamphlet. Named <em>%</em>, it’s dark and well, a lot creepier than her second poem.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"white-space:nowrap;margin:auto -100% auto auto;margin:auto calc(50% - 50vw) auto auto;\">Get out of my head.

It’s a part of the poet themself, whether about their feelings or experiences. In this sense, all poems written by the same people are in fact a continuous flow of the poet’s personal experiences. So a poem can never be finished in this way, it’s just like some underground rivers, some streams seemingly seperated by rocks are in fact connected together. And if this flow just stops moving…think you get the point.</p>\n<p>The poem reminds one of everything. Of her creepy one on the third day, of her leave on Friday, of her telling you she’s suffering from heavy depression in the weekend.</p>\n<p>No, it can’t be. I keep assuring myself. It’s just a mediocre visual novel, only appealing to those weebs who can’t even stand a non-virgin, easily afraid theres no way Sayori will do something she’s fine just a little depression wont do anything shes fine shes fine shes fine she must be fine god she must be fine</p>\n<p>But that feeling can’t go away.</p>\n<p>The screen turns black after you enter Sayori’s house. When it goes bright again, Sayori is there.</p>\n<p>Her body is there.</p>\n<p>And everything speeds from bad to worse henceforth. The game restarts, but this time without Sayori. Her sprite in the title screen is replaced by an amalgam of the other members’ pixels. All previous saves become unloadable(saying you cannot find Sayori’s character file) and then deleted. Then the story unrolls as if Sayori never existed.</p>\n<p>Now the game have glitches here and there, and things are exacerbating for Natsuki and Yuri. They have a quarrel on the same day as before, but without Sayori this time, it remains unchecked.</p>\n<p>If you’ve triggered Natsuki’s event this day, she’ll faint while talking to the protagonist, which, by Monika, is due to her malnutrition. And Natsuki hints that she’s suffering from home abuse. When it comes to Yuri, she begins to show somewhat excessive obsession with MC. It’s like the first run, but the world is falling apart.</p>\n<p>Fear of the unknown may be a little more fundamental than other phobias. One is constantly scared, because what comes next is beyond imagination.</p>\n<p>It’s said that prepare for the worst. Ironically, sometimes the same thing applies to our fear, too. The worst thought pops in our mind, usually when it’s most unwanted. Horror games try to exploit this. They don’t scare you all the time, instead they create a ghastly environment, and the player’s mind will do the rest.</p>\n<p>But DDLC is not entirely getting at it. Though Salvato, its creater, decided to make something eerie with a sugar coat, there’s something, other than pure horror in the game. Without it, DDLC would be a lot less special.</p>\n<p>That’s meta. Sometimes I find my self unable to resist the charm of those self references and fourth-wall breaking stuff.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Beyond-the-topsy-turvy\">Beyond the topsy-turvy</h2>\n<div class=\"alert danger\"><p>You’ve come a long way here, which means about half the plot has been spoiled already. No turning back if you go on reading.\nIf you do have some interest, why not stop here and play the game right away? It’s free and takes just a couple of hours to go through, definitely worth a try.</p>\n<p>And unfortunately, some other innocent games will be spoiled just because they bear some relevance. Amen.</p>\n<p>The names of the games aren’t listed here in case of being a spoiler.</p>\n</div>\n<p>From its greek definition, a metagame should be a game about games, or a game beyond games.</p>\n<p>It’s nothing new. After all, Shakespeare wrote meta-dramas centuries ago. You can make a game about making games, just like what lightnovel writers have been doing recently. Shion Momone, Masamune Izumi, Hashima Itsuki, all of them. The author of <em>Noucome</em> is working on a new one in this genre, too, and the first volume is interesting.</p>\n<p>Sega, near its end of life in the console war, made a game called <em>Segagaga</em>. In this game the player assumes Taro Sega, trying to save Sega by making a great game ,beating the rivaling company DOGMA (a parody of Sony, one of its main competitors back then), and capture as much market share as possible. Ironic jokes and parodies throughout the play make the game a mite different. But it cannot compare to the <em>Seaman</em>, another game published by Sega, in the sense of weirdness. In the game, the player brings up and interact with a man-faced fish.</p>\n<p>And the eccentricity also exists in the first parts of DDLC.</p>\n<p>Without Sayori, one can say the first act is just about ordinary school life, and in the second act, a horrible one. It’s like Danganronpa, where there’s a chapter of (un)common life and then another about class trial.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Monika\nMonika\nMonika shows up, and upon entering the classroom, she realizes that she has screwed it all. So she deletes Yuri and Natsuki’s character file and cleans up the mess. And it’s progressing on to Act 3.</p>\n<p>The game restarts again, and this time, <del>the protagonist</del>the player sits with Monika, face to face. But unlike other girls, Monika face right to the screen in the whole gameplay, so it’s always the case.</p>\n<p>Møn ka admits that she’s the culprit of all the terrible school life, however, it’s due to her obssession with the player, the only reality in the world of fiction.</p>\n<p>All of a sudden, M̶o̶n̶ìką realized all the other members of the literature club were nothing but a piece of code, and their characters were just some archetypes common in Japanese anime, game and stuff. Frantically wanting to be together with the player, she abuses her privilege as the president, forces the player to choose to help her at the weekend, and even interferes with the personality of other girls.</p>\n<p>At the price of the game itself.</p>\n<p>But deleting the character file of others, and even telling how to do it to the player, who she believes would never betray her, turn out to be her undoings. In this act M    a will talk about some random topics, and some of them are thought provoking. The eternity lasts, until the player deletes her character file.</p>\n<p>Being removed leads to Monika reflecting on herself about what she’s done to Sayori, Natsuki, Yuri, and also, the player. She apologizes for ruining the player’s experience as I’m now doing, and admits though fictitious, they’re still her friends. So she decides to restore the world to its initial state. A world the player desires. And a world without Monika.</p>\n<p>Everything seems on track at first. Sayori thanks the player for making the other girls happy, and…</p>\n<p>And for getting rid of Monika. As the new president of the literature club, Sayori has obtained the ability that is once Monika’s. Trying to use it to be with the player forever, Sayori is stopped short by Monika. In the end, Monika says, the Literature Club is no more than a place of grief and despair, so she decides to disband it.</p>\n<p>Then Monika plays her song Your Reality(she picked up the piano for it), while the graphics are displayed. They are removed in the end, along with the game files.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If I don’t know how to love you\nI’ll leave you be</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From here on, the game won’t start. Instead, a farewell message from Monika is displayed.</p>\n<p>If all CGs are seen, there’s an alternative end, where Sayori and the developer thank you and that’s it. That marks the end of the game.</p>\n<p>So in its essence, DDLC is a VN, or it tries to be one, but ended up being a melting pot of love, horror, and meta. Though, DDLC isn’t the first one to do that. The first with file manipulation in mind may be the computer tutorials. Also, years ago, there’s a game called <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/420530/OneShot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OneShot</a> that used similar tricks.</p>\n<p>In this game, the sun died out, which has been providing energy to the world. And our protagonist, Niko, wakes up with a lightbulb in hand. They know from the prophet the lightbulb is the new sun, and Niko, the savior. Player’s goal is to guide Niko to the tower and put the new sun into its place.</p>\n<p>But it’s not that simple as it seems. During the pilgrimage, some puzzles requires the player to find something on the computer, instead of from inside the game. Yes, at a time the game places some files in your document directory for you to solve the problems in game. And in another situation, it even resets your desktop background for hints. And the ways to solve them, sometimes, also feature the same technique: you may need to drag the game window to reveal the hidden information, or, close it to progress to the next scene.</p>\n<p>In the last part of the journey, the player comes to know that the sun needs the savior to operate, that is, if Niko returns the sun to the world, they cannot return to their own home. And if Niko smash the lightbulb, they can return, but at the expense of this world.</p>\n<p>And it’s decisive. If Niko sacrifices themself for everybody’s sake, when you restart the game, only the starting room is shown, bathed in light, without Niko’s presence. If you choose the other route, Niko goes back to their home, but the game will fail to start due to the world’s destruction.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You only have one shot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Don’t know how they managed this in the remake version, but in the original version, the registry of the computer is modified to maintain the state across installations. Games becomes scrupulous when they become commercial(and when they go on Steam), so it may not dare to play with the registry now.</p>\n<p>However unsurprisingly, OneShot closes itself in a non-oneshot way. That’s in the solstice update. In this route, things become clear that the world has come to its end already, and the current one is none but a clone, a piece of code running on Player’s machine. But the Entity, the mind of the game itself, is “untamed”(you can interpret it as insensible), and started to self-destruct in order to protect the innocent victim trapped in the game, that is Niko. Now Niko needs to face the Entity to save the virtual world, and, to return home.</p>\n<p>At a time you even need to move character files into a folder to transport their figures in the game! Only computer tutorials can force one to do that! Maybe the puzzle of deleting a character file comes out of here, we just don’t know. Let’s just state it as striking similarity.</p>\n<p>When it comes to <em>Kimi to Kanojo to Kanojo no Koi.</em>(The Love Between You, Her, and Her, abbreviated <em>Totono</em>), a visual game published by Nitroplus, I’m more inclined to say DDLC is imitating it, since they bear the same core idea: the heroine(a female character with her own route) being the literal “game changer”, while still inside of it. Although to be exact, Monika doesn’t own a route.</p>\n<p>Miyuki Sone is a childhood friend of Shinichi, our protagonist, and she’s also an idol in the school. One can always refer to the game for further details. The point is, first the player is limited to Miyuki’s route, and then, when the player goes down the route of another heroine – Aoi – in its end Miyuki appears, killing Aoi and says the player should be loyal to her and choose her route again and again since the player chose her route in the beginning(yes, she’s aware she is a heroine in a visual novel), before killing Shinichi as well.</p>\n<p>After restarting the game, Miyuki has already changed it, rendering it impossible to choose someone other than Miyuki, in the game. So as one may expect, to save the game from this mire, the player needs something out of the game.</p>\n<p>To solve it, player needs to call a number that comes with the game package. And the very trick dates back to 1998, when the first Metal Gear Solid game was released, wherein Snake needs to contact Meryl, whose codec frequency is on the CD case. Not a CD in the game, but the CD of the game(it’s on PS1, so no DVD or blu-ray, just to clarify).</p>\n<p>By the way, only one of the two heroines can be chosen ultimately, and the consequence is irrevertible unless a reinstallation is done. Yeah, one shot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Non-verdict\">(Non-)verdict</h2>\n<p>Admittedly, Totono comes first, but its influence is limited. Not only because it’s Japanese only, but it’s still a galgame, deep in its core. There are H scenes, the plot mainly talks about the relationship, so on and so forth. However, DDLC is an indie game, its lack of commercial spirit makes a wilder attempt a possibility. The developers don’t care about whether the girls are that appealing, so they can make the girls depressed or abused, mask their eyes with black pixels, let Monika talk about anything in Act 3, leave a bad end only(with a compromised good one). DDLC is special in this sense. And it’s what makes the game appealing, aside from the plot twist.</p>\n<p>Like, I would say Monika’s Writing Tips of the day are sometimes very inspiring(despite the fourth-wall breaking ones). Those are unforgettable.</p>\n<p>So let’s end it with Monika’s last tip of the day:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sometimes when I talk to people who are impressed by my writing, they say things like ‘I could never do that’.</p>\n<p>It’s really depressing, you know?</p>\n<p>As someone who loves more than anything else to share the joy of exploring your passions…</p>\n<p>…it pains me when people think that being good just comes naturally.</p>\n<p>That’s how it is with everything, not just writing.</p>\n<p>When you try something for the first time, you’re probably going to suck at it.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, when you finish, you feel really proud of it and even want to share it with everyone.</p>\n<p>But maybe after a few weeks you come back to it, and you realize it was never really any good.</p>\n<p>That happens to me all the time.</p>\n<p>It can be pretty disheartening to put so much time and effort into something, and then you realize it sucks.</p>\n<p>But that tends to happen when you’re always comparing yourself to the top professionals.</p>\n<p>When you reach right for the stars, they’re always gonna be out of your reach, you know?</p>\n<p>The truth is, you have to climb up there, step by step.</p>\n<p>And whenever you reach a milestone, first you look back and see how far you’ve gotten…</p>\n<p>And then you look ahead and realize how much more there is to go.</p>\n<p>So, sometimes it can help to set the bar a little lower…</p>\n<p>Try to find something you think is pretty good, but not world-class.</p>\n<p>And you can make that your own personal goal.</p>\n<p>It’s also really important to understand the scope of what you’re trying to do.</p>\n<p>If you jump right into a huge project and you’re still amateur, you’ll never get it done.</p>\n<p>So if we’re talking about writing, a novel might be too much at first.</p>\n<p>Why not try some short stories?</p>\n<p>The great thing about short stories is that you can focus on just one thing that you want to do right.</p>\n<p>That goes for small projects in general – you can really focus on the one or two things.</p>\n<p>It’s such a good learning experience and stepping stone.</p>\n<p>Oh, one more thing…</p>\n<p>Writing isn’t something where you just reach into your heart and something beautiful comes out.</p>\n<p>Just like drawing and painting, it’s a skill in itself to learn how to express what you have inside.</p>\n<p>That means there are methods and guides and basics to it!</p>\n<p>Reading up on that stuff can be super eye-opening.</p>\n<p>That sort of planning and organization will really help prevent you from getting overwhelmed and giving up.</p>\n<p>And before you know it…</p>\n<p>You start sucking less and less.</p>\n<p>Nothing comes naturally.</p>\n<p>Our society, our art, everything – it’s built on thousands of years of human innovation.</p>\n<p>So as long as you start on that foundation, and take it step by step…</p>\n<p>You,

写在前面\n\n《伊里野的天空、UFO的夏天》可以说是我比较喜欢的一部轻小说了，所以我个人希望阅读原作之后再回来看这篇博客。当然，没有看过原作对这篇博客内容的理解也不会有什么影响，所以我并不是在要挟。\n\n日文原版在カクヨム上有连载，如果有日语基础的朋友推荐一试。\n\n## 夏天\n\n夏天的一个好处就是衣服可以穿的很少。而且可以游泳。虽然我是旱鸭子。\n\n夏天已经过去了，我在戴着手套一边瑟瑟发抖一边打字。好不痛苦。\n\n但如果现在还是夏天的话，做些什么好？\n\n吃冰淇淋，画勾。\n\n出去转转，画勾。\n\n夏天！天空！大海！画勾，画勾，忘了。\n\n然后我想做的事情就没了。我想挽留夏天，就好像留住了夏天，就留住了青春一样。有的时候做梦，也会梦到和高中、大学的同学在一起，做些有的没的。具体做些什么，却朦朦胧胧想不起来。\n\n这时候，我遇到了《伊里野的天空，UFO的夏天》。\n\n## 梗概\n\n我其实也有在之前的博客里说过，我纠结于是写会有更多人看的书目介绍，还是写我想写的东西。我倾向于写一些个人的东西，书评的好处和坏处都是形式上过于客观了，所以看了一个书评，人们往往会有一种想法——这是对书的客观评价，但不是想这是一个人对书的主观体验。因此我还是会简要介绍这个系列，但是会在千人一面的介绍之间，穿插一些感想。\n\n[中文维基页面（先不要点）](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BC%8A%E9%87%8C%E9%87%8E%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%A9%E7%A9%BA%E3%80%81UFO%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%8F%E5%A4%A9)很讨厌：它剧透了开头，剧透了结尾，就给人一种看完了整个系列的错觉。但我觉得，比起只看结局，更应该看到怎么一步步蓄势，升华，最后到达这样的结尾的。所以我自己来尝试介绍一下《伊里野》好了。\n\n暑假最后一天的晚上，园原中学。浅羽直之从窝了一个半月的山上回来，除了各种各样山里生活用的行李以外什么都没有：别的地方没有去，暑假作业没有写，泳裤也没有带。浅野现在的心情，就和即将上刑场的死囚一样。\n\n“还有13小时就会咣当，第二学期就会无情地开始了。理科老师、二年四班的班主任、35岁单身的河口泰藏，一定会让没交作业的学生们在讲台上排成一列，一面用科学的眼光怒视过来，一面科学地用出席簿吧当吧当敲每个人的头，一面要求科学地说明为什么连暑假作业都没法交的吧。”\n\n决心及时行乐的浅羽，连自己没有带泳裤也不管了，晚上摸进中学准备偷游一番。没成想，泳池已经有先客了。\n\n女孩子想学游泳，却迟迟不肯将脚伸进水中。浅羽费了九牛二虎之力才让她憋成气之后，一切都顺利了——一个小时不到，女孩子居然就能用浮板游了。\n\n女孩子很奇怪：她不苟言笑，但兴奋起来就会流鼻血，而且最最不可思议的，还是埋在她手腕上的一对金属球。如果这也算还好的话，之后突然出现了一群黑衣人，说要送回家，浅羽遵从指令，上了面包车之后，就什么都不记得了。\n\n“醒来之后，自己坐在家附近的公交站的座位上。衣服穿得好好的。本该停在录像带店的自行车也在。”浅羽想到这一个半月跟部长在深山里找UFO的经历。要么一切都是一场梦，要么自己是被外星人绑架了，浅羽想。\n\n第二天开学，这个女孩堂堂出现在自己的教室，她竟然是转学生。她在黑板上写下的名字——伊里野加奈，怎么看怎么像伪名。她一定是外星人。\n\n暑假结束了，但UFO的夏天还在继续。\n\n## 主题\n\n以上就是第一卷第一章的梗概了。应该没什么剧透风险，没有。\n\n“也太长了吧？”毕竟想解释标题中“UFO的夏天”，没有一些篇幅还是会显得比较突兀。想知道“伊里野的天空”是什么意思，就请看原著吧。:)\n\n对我来说，《伊里野》不仅是典型的 boy meets girl 的故事，也是浅羽成长、改变的故事。这样的主题在很多小说里都能看见。放到《你的故事》（[对应文章](/posts/your-story)，英文注意）里也是一样——浑浑噩噩，过去一片空白的天野千寻遇见夏凪灯花，失去夏凪灯花，在没有夏凪灯花的世界里继续负重前行的故事。还有很多作品——藤まる的《时薪300元的死神》、《明天，我将死去，你将复生》，佐野彻夜的《你在月夜里闪耀光芒》、《为这个世界献上i》……为什么一个作者经常写同一个类型的故事……具体浅羽是如何成长的，之后再提。\n\n我无意多说世界系——我明白我说的再多，也只是复述自己从别的地方看来的东西，所以就简单的介绍一下，有兴趣的读者可以自行搜索其滥觞及变迁。\n\n世界系这个词被用来形容有着类似背景、设定和描述风格的一些作品。世界系作品跳过社会，而将个人直接与世界联系起来：个人的举动会影响整个世界。在《伊里野》中，就有不明的外星生物入侵，人类只有黑蝠鲼(black manta) 这一战斗机能够抵御，而伊里野是唯一仅剩的黑蝠鲼的驾驶员；也就是说，她的乐意于否决定了人类的命运。除了《伊里野》，近期上映的天气之子也可以说是典型的世界系作品。\n\n在此基础之上，作为21世纪初的小说，《伊里野》还在很大程度上受95年上映的《EVA》的影响：从大的角度上，世界的危机往往轻描淡写，而将镜头对准主人公的日常生活；从小的细节上，故事都发生在夏天，男主角都是弱受。\n\n## 小小杂感\n\n虽然浅羽是《伊里野》的主人公，但如果要问为什么浅羽平淡无奇的生活中为什么出来了一个UFO的夏天，那就不得不提园原中学新闻部部长水前寺了。\n\n水前寺长得英俊，身高出众，成绩优秀，体育得意，惟一的缺点，就是他是一个怪人。这个怪人不喜欢女生、不喜欢交际、唯独喜欢研究超自然现象，并且每个季节就会换一个主题。在冬季，水前寺占领学校广播站，在上课时间做全校范围的ESP实验。而在春季，为了研究灵异现象，水前寺带着浅羽晚上跑到女厕所去调查是否幽灵出没；而到 6 月 24 日，当浅羽写好了关于校园灵异现象的文章准备发到社刊《园田电波新闻》的时候，迎接他的不是水前寺的赞许，却是一句：\n\n「过时啦啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊」\n\n对水前寺来说，从 UFO 之日开始，灵异现象的春天早就结束，UFO的夏天就开始了。\n\n即使这样，浅羽也毫无怨言，放弃了准备好的材料，默默地跟着水前寺跑到园田空军基地旁边的山上，找了一个暑假的UFO。\n\n所以，当最后浅羽拒绝水前寺的时候，我知道他变得独立了。也知道，UFO的夏天，真真正正落下了它的帷幕。所以也用原文的这一小段，来做全文的总结吧。\n\n## 结语\n\n“就算只有我一个，我也要继续做下去。”\n\n“做——是指做麦田怪圈吧。”\n\n“是”\n\n“就算只有你一个”\n\n“是”\n\n“无论如何”\n\n“是”\n\n然后，水前寺笑了起来。每年每年，不少的女生都会被这笑容诳骗，做出把贵重的纸资源变成情书塞进水前寺的鞋箱里这种最愚蠢的行径。\n\n“随你喜欢吧”\n\n浅羽脸上也浮现起笑容。\n","source":"_posts/iriya.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

6 月 24 日，当浅羽写好了关于校园灵异现象的文章准备发到社刊《园田电波新闻》的时候，迎接他的不是水前寺的赞许，却是一句：\n\n「过时啦啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊」\n\n对水前寺来说，从 UFO 之日开始，灵异现象的春天早就结束，UFO的夏天就开始了。\n\n即使这样，浅羽也毫无怨言，放弃了准备好的材料，默默地跟着水前寺跑到园田空军基地旁边的山上，找了一个暑假的UFO。\n\n所以，当最后浅羽拒绝水前寺的时候，我知道他变得独立了。也知道，UFO的夏天，真真正正落下了它的帷幕。所以也用原文的这一小段，来做全文的总结吧。\n\n## 结语\n\n“就算只有我一个，我也要继续做下去。”\n\n“做——是指做麦田怪圈吧。”\n\n“是”\n\n“就算只有你一个”\n\n“是”\n\n“无论如何”\n\n“是”\n\n然后，水前寺笑了起来。每年每年，不少的女生都会被这笑容诳骗，做出把贵重的纸资源变成情书塞进水前寺的鞋箱里这种最愚蠢的行径。\n\n“随你喜欢吧”\n\n浅羽脸上也浮现起笑容。\n","slug":"iriya","published":1,"updated":"2020-04-01T07:12:23.080Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"ck8h06r6n0035bfvi5fhw08td","content":"<h2

We are reading a story, not just a piece of description. We expect to see SCPs in action, not in tales or behind hardened glass. So the choices are limited: we need them to breach, to break free, in order to unleash their full power. Keeping them in containment wouldn't provide us much opportunity to diverge from the original description text and go further in terms of creation and originality. And that's what their poster suggests, **A large scale containment breach**.\n\n{% image  fancybox group:Iris https://res.cloudinary.com/noirgif/image/upload/v1540390376/nir.moe/kagami-no-kuni-no-iris/iris_poster.jpg \"The poster from Bookstore Hifumi, before its release being delayed to Sept. 4th\" %}\n\nMoreover, something deep in me is curious and excited to see a brand new breath blown into the somewhat gloomy and serious SCP objects. Akira is well known for writing abnormal things: he wrote for Yumenikki, and also that ECHO<sup>1</sup> song by GUMI/Megpoid. Therefore, it is completely sensical for him to put his hands on the SCPs, which is also a symbol of abnormality. \n\nAdmittedly it is a hard take: you may end up with an amalgamate which lets everybody down and pisses off readers from both side. But it's Akira we're talking about, maybe he can make it. At least that's what I thought when I saw him on the cover.\n\nAnd here's Shidu, who has made PVs for almost all Kagerou Project songs(some others done by the hands of Wannyanpuu), then the illustrations for the KagePro lightnovel. I just mention him by the way, though I cannot think of someone better than him to handle illustrations for cool things like the SCP.\n\nThat's what I thought before reading it, and after reading, I would say: that's what one would expect out of Akira.\n\nThe one and only good thing is that it is good for an introduction to the SCPs. In the novel, the specialties and backstories of the SCPs are carefully covered. Like how Iris discovered her ability, and the tragedy MTF Rho-71 \"Origami Toads\" encounters during their exploration of the carnival of horrors(SCP-823). And it even goes to length about what an SCP is, and what the Foundation is for. So almost everybody could enjoy this novel without looking up everything and wonder what on earth they are talking about.\n\nMaybe it is also the reason for why almost all SCPs involved lie in the range of 000 ~ 999: they enjoy more popularity. However, it's just a possibility.\n\nBut one thing a reader might notice is that there are some changes to the original SCP stories. For example, in the SCP-823 expedition, Akira saved one of the Rho-71 soldiers from forced sexual entry into the eye. Instead, he killed the poor soldier with a SCP-173 style neck-snapping by the hippo mascot, and then blow up the displaced head as if it is a balloon. It's OK, since usually the mascots are the ones that hand out balloons to visitors. I guess Akira had to do it because \"forced sexual entry into the left eye\" may be too much for a casual lightnovel reader, let alone for himself to depict such a scene.\n\nSomething making me feeling unsatisfied is that we are dealing with safe objects most of the time. Except for the Teddy bear, the carnival of horrors, and Dr. Bright's pendant, almost everything that plays a part in the story is safe. Some other unsafe objects, like the old man, the young girl, and the sculpture, are only mentioned orally. \n\nThe thing that confuses me the most is that almost everybody does not treat the main character as a D-class personnel, even though he's wearing that orange jacket all the time. For example, he's allowed to operate the coffee machine, which needs security clearance 2 to do so. And he's not terminated on sight by those MTF soldiers when in the amusement park: they should kill any straying D-class personnel, but in the end they leave him alive. So effectively the main character is just cosplaying a D-class personnel, nobody takes it for real.\n\nAnd the most distressing part, there is no large scale containment breach as the poster boasted, which is a huge let down for me. Probably we can witness one in the sequel(it's Kagami no Kuni no Iris **1**, so there will probably be a 2, if the sale goes well of course). But first thing first, Akira needs to set up the stage, and Book 1 might serve such a purpose.\n\nHowever, the book ends in a way that even if Akira won't write a book 2, it will be still alright. To be exact, the protagonist, ███, is found a visitor from a parallel universe. His ability, with Iris' help, makes this inter-world travel possible. In the epilogue \"Milestone Iris, he's sent back to world he belongs to, so the whole story is wrapped up where it begins.\n\nIt's, well, not that bad. Everyone's doing it. Even though I like the way of leaving a cliffhanger and keeping everybody in suspense, like what Falcom did with the Cold Steel, the reality is hard: one don't know when he stops until he stops. There are many obstacles to the sequel: the sales, the reception, and the worse among them, the writer himself. And if one keeps the expectation too high and fails to answer it, it will be a hard landing. Although Akira's nowhere near Hikari Sugii and Hitoma Iruma, he is still eligible for one of the guys who are the best to start a story, but the worst to conclude it. He's not working on series(including the cases where he tried but failed) since the end of Sasami, which is Nov. 2013. So it might be hard for him to maintain the momentum and continue the adventure. So such an end may indicate his lack of confidence, or simply his lack of ideas for the second volume.\n\nSo the best we can do is to be patient and hopeful, to wait for the sequel of the story. I can give no final judgment until the final piece is in place.\n\n## Footnotes\n1. It has millions of views on Niconico and Youtube but I don't know what the hell's going on.

to fight our ways up the tower.\n\nThe tower of Yggdrasil is still looking down upon the world from the center today.

It is almost cliche to put some strong monster in the floors of ten's multiples, and the AI is clearly sticking to this common practice when creating the Second.\n\nOne dragon was already beat when we first enter this tower, that is, the mother dragon.

But now, after countless battles, our team is invincible, and the dragon doesn't stand a chance.\n\nWhoosh! its sweeps the ground with its left claw, but in vain. It took too much damage to maintain its swift actions. Time to deliver the last strike. I called out to my little sister.\n\n\"Miu!

When I turn it on, it's still showing interference pattern.\n\nThe DNA computer is turned off now. Apeiria is accidentally created from it when a lightning cut off its power about a year ago.

One year ago, She had a quarrel with her mother, who fell unconscious soon afterwards and died days later. And Kuon never had a chance to apologize. Since then, I haven't got in contact with her as much.\n\nAfter having lunch in Asakusa, we decide to return.\n\nBang, and the door closed.

Is it right to spend so much time together, only to make the parting more heartbreaking?\n\nAnd who is Thinker after all? Is he the observer who's been peeking into this world? Why does the observer want to do with Apeiria?\n\nI take out my phone from the pocket. In it there are the mails sent by my future self.\n\n\"There are two Thinkers.\"\n\n\"The observer is human.\"\n\nAnd things like that. I pondered about these things again and again, but to no avail.

Modeled after the boundary tower in Amakusa, Tokyo, which is the birthplace of a phenomenal VRMMO game, Yggdrasil is a lofty tower, too.</p>\n<p><em>Like a needle piercing into the space.</em></p>\n<p>A crystal one, though, to fit in the overall fantasy art style of the Second. And like the boundary tower, Yggdrasil boasts a whole lot of floors – 1000 of them, to be exact – crammed with all kinds of monsters and challenges.</p>\n<p>And we are the first one to set our feet on the tenth floor. It is almost cliche to put some strong monster in the floors of ten’s multiples, and the AI is clearly sticking to this common practice when creating the Second.</p>\n<p>One dragon was already beat when we first enter this tower, that is, the mother dragon. It was quite a tough one: it even nearly managed to suffocate us by burning out all the oxygen with its breath. But now, after countless battles, our team is invincible, and the dragon doesn’t stand a chance.</p>\n<p>Whoosh! its sweeps the ground with its left claw, but in vain. It took too much damage to maintain its swift actions. Time to deliver the last strike. I called out to my little sister.</p>\n<p>“Miu! Covering fire!” “Gotcha!”</p>\n<p>The dragon roared in pain as the bullet penetrates the dragon’s eyes. The monster raises its head, it want to cast a breath.</p>\n<p>“Kuon!” “Needless to say!”</p>\n<p>Kuon cast the spell, which forms a shield protected all of us from the devastating breath. I looked to Apeiria, and she knows what I’m gonna do in an glimpse.</p>\n<p>“You are powered up, owner, get in there!”</p>\n<p>I run forward towards to dragon, to deliver the final blow.</p>\n<p>“Mashiro, come back!” “Roger!” The little silouette who’s attacking with combos jumps back, agile like a humming bird.</p>\n<p>A few steps forth, I get face to face with the hideous monster. Time for my ultimate sword.</p>\n<p>“1/8!”</p>\n<p>Eight beams spreads out in an instant, all of them punching the dragon, lighting the last moment of this floor master.</p>\n<p>With a death agony, the large figure collapsed to the ground and dispersed.</p>\n<p>After I confirmed the death of the dragon, other party members come to me.</p>\n<p>“Miu, good shot.”</p>\n<p>“Of course. Who you think I am?”</p>\n<p>And I turned to my childhood friend.</p>\n<p>“Kuon, your spells are of great help, too.” “Reiichi, it is okay to depend more on your older sister, you get it?”</p>\n<p>“Well done, Mashiro.” “Eeh?! Th-th-thank you!” The introverted junior is still shy about compliments today.</p>\n<p>“Apeiria.” I hugged the girl with silver hair. “You are the best.”</p>\n<p>“Owner, plus, hug, equals, happiness.” The girl in my embrace replied with her monotonic voice, but with a tinge of delight.</p>\n<p>“Hentai…” Complaints comes from the little sister with a cold-eyed gaze.</p>\n<p>“…”</p>\n<p>“Owner?”</p>\n<p>“…”</p>\n<p>It feels real, but it is unreal.</p>\n<p>My eyes are open now. It’s not inside the magnificent crystal tower. Not but my monochromatic bedroom.</p>\n<p>The window is wide open. A gust of December’s chilly wind breaks in, across my face and between my fingers.</p>\n<p>“It’s … cold.” The wind must receive a summons for trespassing.</p>\n<p>Today Apeiria will set off to Second, which has been already a hell. No one could return from that world of death. But there are no other options: she should have gone there a year ago, and this probation is as much as I could get.</p>\n<p>The digital clock says it’s 7. I step into my slippers and out of my bedroom.</p>\n<p>There is already one up.</p>\n<p>“Good morning, owner.” The silver-haired girl notices me.</p>\n<p>“Morning, Apeiria.” I try to make myself sound more energetic.</p>\n<p>The dried-up response echoes in the empty house. There is nobody besides the two of us.</p>\n<p>Miu isn’t here. She isn’t in this world any more.</p>\n<p>She was disposed by her mother. Miu was created as a clone of that woman, who has been haunted by the shadows of her aborted child.</p>\n<p>I walk to the kitchen, Apeiria is preparing the breakfast.</p>\n<p>“A few minutes and it will be done, owner.”</p>\n<p>The breakfast time in Kirishima’s is filled with silence. The clashing sounds of utensils reverbrate in the room.</p>\n<p>After I’m done with the meal, I speak to Apeiria.</p>\n<p>“It’s the last day, isn’t it?”</p>\n<p>“Affirmative, owner.”</p>\n<p>“Then let’s hang out.”</p>\n<p>We first arrives at the AI circle in the school. Full name “Lovable AI Circle”, the circle has had two members – I, the founder, and Mashiro, who I forcibly dragged in. After I created Apeiria here, the five of us have had a lot memories here – making the VR MMORPG Second, and playing it together as a team. But Mashiro is not here.</p>\n<p>She is dead from radiation in Boundary’s beta test, when the machine suddenly malfunctioned.</p>\n<p>A double-slit box sits on the table. When I turn it on, it’s still showing interference pattern.</p>\n<p>The DNA computer is turned off now. Apeiria is accidentally created from it when a lightning cut off its power about a year ago. And I managed to get her a body by hacking the genetic research facility.</p>\n<p>There is nothing to do here. After the door is shutted with a huge noise, and silence dominates the school again.</p>\n<p>Next stop is the boundary tower. Usually it was once full of people, especially when Boundary was in tests. After that accident, people are showing concerns about safety issues of the VR games, and the development of Boundary is put to a halt.</p>\n<p>“Owner, will we be seeing Kuon?”</p>\n<p>“Forget about it.”</p>\n<p>Kuon’s father is the creator of the Boundary, so the family lives on the top floor of the boundary tower.

■”“嗯”“噢”“这样”“好的”，然后挂了电话。</p>\n<p>“学校说这是一个特别的项目，邀请像你一样的学生参加。”</p>\n<p>“反正就去呗，也不会差到哪里去。”</p>\n<p>“总比去什么技校好吧。”</p>\n<p>再差也不会沦落到什么技校吧。</p>\n<hr>\n<p>在火车上摇摇晃晃几小时后，又在公交车上摇摇晃晃半小时，终于到了学校的东区。马路这边是大门，那边是一家罗森，罗森好像在做什么活动，海报上画着一个卡通小女孩飘在空中，下面是炸鸡图片。</p>\n<p>有点气势的长方形大门，走进一看，左半边拉着栅栏，只有右半边能进去，令人倍觉促狭。大概知道我是新生，门卫也没多问。</p>\n<p>拖着行李又走了几步，感觉不太对。“这是什么味道？”我环顾周围，四下无人，只有蝉鸣。</p>\n<p>丁字路口的地上有一个指路的海报，上面标了去往大礼堂的路：右拐，沿着路（这条路叫郭沫若路）一直往南就能看到了。路线简单点帮大忙了。</p>\n<p>沿着郭沫若路又走了一会儿，路有点上坡，但走路没什么问题。</p>\n<p>隐隐约约听到翻书的声音，越往前走，翻书的声音就越来越大。我突然感觉有点恐怖。我最终找到了声音的来源——一幢正面土红色的建筑物，像书本一样的东西从楼梯上方的门中喷涌而出。空气中的气味更加浓了。</p>\n<p>这是什么鬼地方。</p>\n<p>我有一种逃跑的冲动。</p>\n<p>但好像有一种不可名状的的力量，拖着我的身体不由自主地往着书的冲积扇走去。我看向地上喷出的书，虽然书本不计其数，但是种类只有两种：电磁学千题解和——数学分析习题集。我感到一阵目眩。</p>\n<p>“别动！”突然背后传来一声喊，没等我反应过来，我的手就被抓住了。</p>\n<p>“快跑！”抓住我的手的人拉起我跑起来。行李被丢在原地。后来一合计，还好学校不给新生带电脑，不然就白给了。</p>\n<p>当然跑的时候我没想这么多。顶多就是，她的头发飘到我脸上了，这种无关紧要的想法。</p>\n<p>我们沿着来时的路往回跑，一路跑到了广场旁的一家白顶的小屋子才停下。推开玻璃门进去，我找了把椅子坐了下来。</p>\n<p>“要不给你冲杯咖啡吧，边喝边说？”她看向柜台上的咖啡机。</p>\n<p>看样子这是间咖啡店。</p>\n"},{"title":"故事的终结","date":"2017-11-06T06:01:10.000Z","lang":"zh-cn","label":"end

Off","date":"2018-03-18T20:41:55.000Z","lang":"en","label":"memory loss games","_content":"\n\nThe title of this post refers to the galgame series produced by the once existing KID, though there is no obvious relevance between the game and this  article(<span class=spoiler>though the protagonist in Yubikiri no Kioku does have a memory loss and mistakes himself for someone else</span>). By the way, an eighth installment of it is near its publication by MAGES, the franchise's now owner, along with GloriaWorks. It was once decided to be a homage to one of the songs of Jin's Kagerou Project, but you are not seeing it here because I forgot that and went for this one.\n\n{% alert warning %}\nThis article contains spoilers, which may harm or even completely ruin your playing or reading experience of the works, including but not limited to:\n\nGame *Shichinen go de Matteiru* (waiting for you seven years later), fumi\\_md\nLightnovel *Tosho Meikyuu* (the labyrinth of book), Juuji Shizuka, Shirabi\nLightnovel *Boku no Shiranai Rabukome* (the love comedies I don't know), Kashimoto Tsubame, Pyon-Kti\nLightnovel *Owari no Album* (album of the end), Sugii Hikari\n\nNote the pen names are kept as is: their surnames -- if those could be called surnames -- sits before their names.\nMake sure before reading on.\n{% endalert %}\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nOne can never overemphasize the import of memories. Without them, we would be brushing our teeth repeatedly until death. Those who don't brush their teeth in the morning will be a little more fortunate -- they will die from eating too much breakfast.\n\nIn addition, the overall development of humanity will be hampered, given the fact that we learn by memorizing. Imagine a physicist has to go over the basic of physics every day, just like eating breakfast, never could they reach anywhere beyond what a person can go through in one day. Even if we do not need the most elemental to progress, it still bears some liking to the game of Tiny Wings: the bird flaps its wings trying to fly as far as it can, only to be caught up by the darkness in the end.\n\nBut that's not what I'm driving at, since the it is not interesting enough to erase all people's memory periodically, what is interesting is to manipulate a person's, as is present in abundance in today's works. It is one of the most easy ways to set up suspense by removing the past from the protagonist. It is safe to assume almost all memory loss twists serve this specific purpose, but the ways to do it can vary -- getting hit by a car, magic, such and such.\n\nA mobile game I've mentioned in a previous post -- *waiting for you 7 years later*, or whatever it translates to -- features the very plot. The protagonist, losing his memories of a childhood friend but only the appointment with her, returned to his hometown after seven years as promised, and there by going through time loops, he comes to know what really happened seven years ago, and decides to go back to save her. The loss of memory, as it turns out in the end, is the reason behind all these ruckuses. And to add to it, the removal of it was intended for everything to happen seven years later. So the loss of memory could be used not only for suspenses but also as an integral part of the story.\n\nAnd the same mechanism is also utilized by Juuji Shizuka to near the extent of plagiarism in their lightnovel *Libryrinth*(I just made the word up, the name of the book is *Tosho Meikyuu*, namely \"the maze of book\"). The maze of books is, as its name suggests, a maze full of magic books located under the city of Alexandria. Soushi Okutsuki, in the incident five years ago, witnessed the murder case of his father Kai Okutsuki there, who is a Doctor Magna and accredited the triumph over the Devil. At the same time, Soushi lost his memory and capability to use magic. After spending 5 years away in Japan, he returns to the spot trying to find out what happened on that day. However, when he suddenly wakes up from a bad dream wherein he gets killed, he finds himself in the dormitory of Apothecaria, an academy in Alexandria. And soon he realizes it is not a dream at all, and he is still alive because he's become a vampire, the most loathed of all species. To make things worse, as a side effect of becoming a vampire, he can only maintain memory for about 8 hours, plus the capacity of a 1000-page *Saigo no Inori* (the last prayer), one of the rare and powerful magic books. In order to find out the truth as before, and now the book which cures amnesia, Soushi sets out down the maze again with Alteria, the origin and most highly ranked vampire(called \"high daylight walker\" in the book) and the person who saved him by turning him into one of them.\n\nSo one may ask, why bother going into detail about nearly the same plot again? You could probably take a hint from my [previous post](/2018/01/26/ddlc/). But let's save the surprise for now. The killer who beat the crap of Soushi yesterday shows up in the same classroom, and after another painstaking, no, livestaking fight, she, Erica by name, apologizes for having been mistaking Soushi for one of the assassins sent by the \"Scenario Writer\", who's the mastermind behind the death of Soushi's father, from whom she has owed a lot. And it's known now that she's trying to locate and bring justice to the Scenario Writer. Ironically, she nearly takes the life of her benefactor's son twice. She joins the party on the second day out of guilty, when Soushi departs for the labyrinth.\n\nAs the story progresses, more about *Saigo no Inori* is known: it is not a book that records memories, it is one that MANIPULATES memories. More surprisingly, what we are reading is the content of *Saigo no Inori* itself. Yes, it is a meta-fiction. It could never be more substantiated than by the pages torn in the middle of this novel to protect the tactics from being known by the Devil, who is able to read other's mind.\n\nThe story plays with the concept of memory, interfering with one's memory can even render the baddest vampire innocuous, or vice versa. And our emotions -- love, fear, and determination -- all rely on our memories to come into being. Soushi's affection with Alteria, and his resolution to protect others, all turn out to be implanted five years ago, like in *Inception*, by manipulating his memories. In this way we can relate to a computer: if one has the access to all the memory of a computer, then they can make arbitrary code be executed on it, or in other words, they have complete control over the computer. That's why the Scenario Writer is called such: tampering with everybody's memory to make everything go as expected.\n\nThere's a lot more to this lightnovel, just as the author(of this lightnovel, not Saigo no Inori, since the author of that will be Soushi) said in the postface: all things they like are crammed together to make this book. There is the obscured boundary between reality and fantasy, existential crisis, and the most of all, the glorious loliferatu(amalgamate of \"loli\" and \"Nosferatu\", coined by Sagara Sou in one of his lightnovels). The joke aside, much of the book is left out here because I'm lazy. Although I just fumbled upon it in the store, but it has what one could expect from a one-volume lightnovel, as it turns out in the end. The one-volume ones never fails to impress me -- they have the creativity, the plot twist, everything; but a reader usually finds nothing but a new disposable stereotype character as a story moves on to another volume. Maybe it is due to the lengthy process of creating a lightnovel, since the game industry is not troubled by the same problem too much, because a game is released as a whole, mostly.\n\nBecause most of my points are elaborated here, I won't go into much detail about this novel from Kashimoto, at least for now. In this novel, Yuuta Ashiya, who values the outcome over the process, accidentally discovers his skill to pass time in a sec. For example, he can jump right to the end of school without possibly having the memories of being caught sleeping in class. He makes a jump, and he becomes the boyfriend with Nozomi Yanagito, the infamous delinquent in his class. And another jump, he loses her, almost. The lightnovel, though with love comedy in its name, is more of a \"seishun shosetsu\" (youth novel), which talks about the dialectics between the process and the outcome. And what piques my interest is that the author managed to wrest out a sequel -- which will be out in a few days -- from themselves, despite the end in the first volume.\n\nWhat if a whoosh, and I'm not remember everything? This novel reminds me of this and prompt me to write something to make a record.\n\nSo, please write down what you see and feel, no matter how trivial they seem. That's what make you who you are. Besides, the odds and ends of life could be a precious source of inspirations. That concludes my writing tips of the day.\n","source":"_posts/memory.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 'Memories, Off'\ntags:\n  - recommendation\n  - literature\n  - lightnovel\n  - game\ncategory:\n  - writing\ndate: 2018-03-18 15:41:55\nlang: en\nlabel: memory loss games\n---\n\n\nThe title of this post refers to the galgame series produced by the once existing KID, though there is no obvious relevance between the game and this  article(<span class=spoiler>though the protagonist in Yubikiri no Kioku does have a memory loss and mistakes himself for someone else</span>).

There is the obscured boundary between reality and fantasy, existential crisis, and the most of all, the glorious loliferatu(amalgamate of “loli” and “Nosferatu”, coined by Sagara Sou in one of his lightnovels). The joke aside, much of the book is left out here because I’m lazy. Although I just fumbled upon it in the store, but it has what one could expect from a one-volume lightnovel, as it turns out in the end. The one-volume ones never fails to impress me – they have the creativity, the plot twist, everything; but a reader usually finds nothing but a new disposable stereotype character as a story moves on to another volume. Maybe it is due to the lengthy process of creating a lightnovel, since the game industry is not troubled by the same problem too much, because a game is released as a whole, mostly.</p>\n<p>Because most of my points are elaborated here, I won’t go into much detail about this novel from Kashimoto, at least for now. In this novel, Yuuta Ashiya, who values the outcome over the process, accidentally discovers his skill to pass time in a sec. For example, he can jump right to the end of school without possibly having the memories of being caught sleeping in class. He makes a jump, and he becomes the boyfriend with Nozomi Yanagito, the infamous delinquent in his class. And another jump, he loses her, almost. The lightnovel, though with love comedy in its name, is more of a “seishun shosetsu” (youth novel), which talks about the dialectics between the process and the outcome. And what piques my interest is that the author managed to wrest out a sequel – which will be out in a few days – from themselves, despite the end in the first volume.</p>\n<p>What if a whoosh, and I’m not remember everything? This novel reminds me of this and prompt me to write something to make a record.</p>\n<p>So, please write down what you see and feel, no matter how trivial they seem. That’s what make you who you are. Besides, the odds and ends of life could be a precious source of inspirations. That concludes my writing tips of the day.</p>"},{"title":"multilanguage","date":"2018-10-11T05:55:17.000Z","lang":"zh-cn","_content":"\n借助 [hexo generator multilingual

点。</p>\n<p>很有趣的小说。男性向的。</p>\n<p>因为看轻小说不用带脑子，所以这也是不带脑子的评论。这也是我的一种心理安慰。一个人如果因为一本无趣的小说而熬夜，那未免也太空虚了吧。</p>\n<p>在访谈中，关于连载，作者纸城大致是这么说的：如果小说被印刷成书出版，那只能让读者享受 3 小时；而如果放在网络上连载，则能够让读者每周都享受 168

了。当然这也不代表我个人观点，虽然说人会把记忆改造成自己想要的样子，但我觉得这观点怎样都好，所以就忘的差不多了，更别说根据自己的好恶改造了。</p>\n<p>我个人觉得误会是这部作品的一个支撑，也是全篇反复出现的一个要素。男女主人公因为小小的误会，关系出现了隔阂，导致最终的分手。男主自认为讨厌女主，但心里还给女主留着位置，他并努力和女主保持着适当的距离；而反观女主，男主在面前的时候针锋相对，不在面前的时候变身大花痴。导致怎么看，都是变相秀恩爱。</p>\n<p>这让我想起了作品时间和现实时间同步的一部网络小说，其天气也是忠实于日本某地的天气。可名字忘了。</p>\n<p>今天下雨。</p>\n<p>看了一点人间失格，感觉不能理解。先不管三张相片是想表达什么（从内容上看推测是概括了主角的一生），几页看下来，大致是一位神经性厌食症少年的独白。具体是不是还要继续往下看。</p>\n<h2

But everybody knows that we cannot just stop thinking about it -- the time paradox, the other self of that time, the butterfly effect. All we do is a little retreat from reality to virtuality, and in the fictional world, where the law of excluded middle doesn't work, the impossible can become possible.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nThe past is also like a mirror. It reflects the current, and reveals the future. Though I'd like to babble more about reflection upon self, this is really not the place for such cliched preachment.\n\nAt least, the never ending fantasies about going to the past has spawned a ever increasing bunch of works about this topic. And this game is just one of them.\n\nThis game just suprisingly appeared in my Steam library[^1]. I have heard of it years ago, but haven't come to purchase and play it. So I decided to give it a try. And that's the whole story.\n\n## Part 2\n\nTime travellers are, technically, travellers. Those works featuring trips usually have a great emphasis on encounters and parting ways. A light novel named *The Journey of a Witch* might well fall into this kind. I haven't read it, so I'm not sure. What I'm certain about, is that *Spice and Wolf* doesn't care much about it. Maybe it's because Lawrence always faces unfriendly people. *Girls' Last Tour* is similar, although it is a bit more about sightseeing.\n\nIn a journey, one runs into all kinds of people, and usually, they never cross their paths again. So we learn how to say goodbye.\n\nAnd the same, somehow, applies to the time travellers as well. Usually after departing from a spacetime, a world line, one cannot comes back. And unlike the negotiable spatial distance, the temporal one is absolute.\n\n*Back to the Mother* features similar plots. Despite its frivolous atmosphere, bold fanservices, and the title, the manga tries to tell a serious story. Yuu, the protagonist, is such a fan of his mother, an once idol band member, that is near the extent of Oedipus complex. But one day, the mom's glorious figure mysterically turns into a graceless unsliced nigiri(sushi, maki, whatever) with an face only appearing in comedy mangas. Along with this eerie transformation, he often find himself transported to the past, when his mother was of his age.\n\nEach time he was sent to the past, Yuu gets to know, a little about his mother's youth. And at the same time, he and Hanada get closer to each other, his teacher but once a friend of his mother's. While he manages to fix his mom's past the way he knows, Hanada is becoming more and more important to him. Finally, he uncovers the reason why his mother turns into a sushi roll, and prevents it.\n\nKnowing Yuu will be sent back to his time and unable to come back, Hanada calls him out to a park, to say farewell to him, and to this forever unrequitted love.\n\nThe manga was appeared to be, somehow, hastily concluded. But the up side of it is, it saved the work from lengthy, remotely related stuff, like new characters, stories about the new characters, new places and fanservices, which is common for many serial works. It is usually good, or, OK, for those slow-paced works, for example, *Boarding School Juliet* or *Nisekoi*(maybe more prevalent in lightnovels), but it really hurts the compact story line, which is one of the centers of this manga, the other one is, of course, the tragic female main character Hanada.\n\n## Part 1\n\n*The Season of 12 Colors* tells a story like *My Tomorrow, Your Yesterday*(shortened to *Bokuasu*).\n\nAnd I think it somehow well conclude the main plot of this story. So if you have read the novel, or watched the film, you are already spoiled.

But one day, the mom's glorious figure mysterically turns into a graceless unsliced nigiri(sushi, maki, whatever) with an face only appearing in comedy mangas. Along with this eerie transformation, he often find himself transported to the past, when his mother was of his age.\n\nEach time he was sent to the past, Yuu gets to know, a little about his mother's youth. And at the same time, he and Hanada get closer to each other, his teacher but once a friend of his mother's. While he manages to fix his mom's past the way he knows, Hanada is becoming more and more important to him. Finally, he uncovers the reason why his mother turns into a sushi roll, and prevents it.\n\nKnowing Yuu will be sent back to his time and unable to come back, Hanada calls him out to a park, to say farewell to him, and to this forever unrequitted love.\n\nThe manga was appeared to be, somehow, hastily concluded.

稔和祐介在争论从侧面看烟花到底是圆的还是扁的，于是决定去烟花大会地点侧面的灯塔去看。\n\n回家后磕到的伤口变得严重，被祐介建议去他家的诊所去看，顺便告诉なずな不能和她去烟花大会，原来他们在泳池旁边谈及的是约会的事情。\n\n涂好了药，也向なずな传达了消息，出了诊所的典道被なずな邀请转一转，途中なずな提起游泳比赛的事，说自己在那时突然决定和赢者约会，或者说，离家出走，她本以为岛田会赢。然而这小小的散步也被なずな母亲的出现打断，なずな被母亲强行带走，只留下包中的东西散了一地。心情难过而又无处发泄的典道捡起了杂物中的一个球，奋力地向墙壁砸去……\n\n“如果，我赢了那场比赛的话！”\n\n随着一阵眩晕，典道回到了游泳比赛的时候，然而这一次他赢了祐介，赢得了和なずな的约会，于是典道加入了なずな的离家出走计划，打算着能走多远就走多远。不过还是在车站被なずな母亲抓住了。之后典道和其他小伙伴合流去了灯塔，看到人生中第一次的侧面的烟花……是扁平的。\n\n典道回忆起了在之前的世界的事情，从包里拿出了那个球，奋力地向烟花扔去……\n\n“如果，我和なずな坐上了电车的话！”\n\n总之这样，典道和なずな踏上了一段奇妙的旅程，但再怎么从现实面前逃避，分离的时刻还是会到来。\n\n“这种世界怎么会存在。”\n\n最后，在海边看到的焰火，是完美的圆形，脚踝的疼痛也渐渐鲜明起来。望着渐渐远去的なずな，典道默默起誓：如果下一次再见到なずな，一定要对她说：\n\n“最喜欢了！”\n\n## 感想、杂谈\n<a id=\"kanso\"></a>\n\n真的是一段奇妙的旅行。\n\n买到这本书是6月，看完之后才知道电影是8月上映。是不是很奇怪？通常小说都是在电影之后才有的，像君名啊，秒速啊这样的。\n\n这里提到这两部电影纯粹是因为（这两部的）导演一样，没有别的意思。\n\n或许大家都知道了，这部作品改编自岩井俊二的原作电视剧《烟花》，这部作品使得他获得了93年关东电影协会的新人赏，明明是电视剧。由于当初是在一个叫<ruby>If<rt>If もしも</rt></ruby>的电视剧系列下拍的，因此标题也是为了和系列统一搞成了这么长的样子。动画版本中，剧情被大根脚本改了很多，比如小学生变成初中生<span class=\"spoiler\">其实这篇文章一开始写的时候也把典道当成小学生了</span>，一次穿越变成了三次（上面只提及两次，感兴趣的话可以看小说或者电影），而且出现了这个“如果球”，用它来触发穿越，并且用球的消失来表示故事走向结束，而且这个球也是なずな的感情纽带，具体是什么我也忘了（假）。总而言之，听起来好像多了很多趣味<span class=\"spoiler\">没看过岩井老师原作</span>）。\n\nIf番组的主题就是：在一个选择的地方做出交叉路，分别探索两种选择之后的结果。因此其标题都是<ruby>“是……，还是……”<rt>……するか、……するか</rt></ruby>的形式。“如果……就好了”或许是很多人都至少想过一次的事情。\n\n然而，变成圆柱形的西瓜棒，弯弯曲曲的铁路，椭圆形的烟花，都暗示着，这样的世界根本不存在。无论怎么逃避，现实总会追上来。\n\n所以哭也好，笑也好，挣扎也好，去面对吧。\n\n这就是生活。\n","source":"_posts/fireworks.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

Wait ... shit.\n\nForget about monads, let's go with another example:\n\n```ocaml\nmodule type Stack = sig\n    type _ t\n    val create : unit -> 'a t\n    val push : 'a t -> 'a -> 'a t\n    val pop : 'a t -> 'a t * 'a option\n    val empty : 'a t -> bool\nend;;\n```\n\nAnd an implementation by list here:\n```ocaml\nmodule LStack : Stack = struct\n    type 'a t = 'a list\n    let create = fun () -> []\n    let push s x = x::s\n    let pop x = match x with\n        |x::xs -> xs, Some x\n        |[] -> [], None\n    let empty x = match x with\n        |x::xs -> false\n        |[] -> true\nend;;\n```\n\nEverything works fine without the knowledge that `LStack` uses list for the stack. Say you create a new stack using `LStack.create`, there is no way for you to use it as a list, though it is one.\n\n```\nutop # let mystack = LStack.create ();;\nval mystack : '_a LStack.t = <abstr>\nutop # assert(mystack=[]);;\nError: This expression has type 'a list but an expression was expected of type\n         'b LStack.t\n```\n\nThat's abstraction in a nutshell.\n\nThe existential type is like this: ${*S, t} : {\\exists X, T}$ means that type t, coupled with implementation S, makes a package that have an abstract type X with signature T. For the `LStack`, the analogy would be:\n\n$$\n*list \\sim *S\\\\\n\\{create = \\cdots, push = \\cdots, pop = \\cdots\\} \\sim t\\\\\n\\{create : \\forall a.unit \\rightarrow X[a],\\ push : \\forall a.X[a] \\rightarrow a \\rightarrow  X[a],\\ pop : \\forall a.X[a] \\rightarrow X[a] * option[a]\\}\\sim T\n$$\n\nAnd there is the pack operation, which erases one or more types and introduces an implementation:\n$$\\frac{\\Gamma \\vdash t : [X\\rightarrow U]T}{\\Gamma \\vdash \\{*U, t\\}\\ as\\ \\{\\exists X, T\\} : \\{\\exists X, T\\}}$$\n\n## Misc\n\n> 愛されたくて偽って　もっともっと自然に笑えばいいかな","source":"_posts/rec-4-7-2018.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 'Records of 4/7 to 4/9, 2018'\ndate: 2018-04-10 15:12:01\ntags:\n    - diary\nlang: en\nlabel: record 2018.4.7\n---\n\n## Records for 4-5 and 4-6\n\nDancing disco at the cementry.\n\n## About Mathematica\n\nMathematica 11 could not be started after a freetype upgrade.\n\nWhen run in command line, it emits an error like [this](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/57948).\n\nAccording to [the gentoo forum site](https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-8198000.html?sid=ab27c1ca8e1927691858595185e18284).

For the `LStack`, the analogy would be:\n\n$$\n*list \\sim *S\\\\\n\\{create = \\cdots, push = \\cdots, pop = \\cdots\\} \\sim t\\\\\n\\{create : \\forall a.unit \\rightarrow X[a],\\ push : \\forall a.X[a] \\rightarrow a \\rightarrow  X[a],\\ pop : \\forall a.X[a] \\rightarrow X[a] * option[a]\\}\\sim T\n$$\n\nAnd there is the pack operation, which erases one or more types and introduces an implementation:\n$$\\frac{\\Gamma \\vdash t : [X\\rightarrow U]T}{\\Gamma \\vdash \\{*U, t\\}\\ as\\ \\{\\exists X, T\\} : \\{\\exists X, T\\}}$$\n\n## Misc\n\n> 愛されたくて偽って　もっともっと自然に笑えばいいかな","slug":"rec-4-7-2018","published":1,"updated":"2020-04-01T07:12:23.236Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"ck8h06r7r007ibfvi4091fpqk","content":"<h2 id=\"Records-for-4-5-and-4-6\">Records for 4-5 and 4-6</h2>\n<p>Dancing disco at the cementry.</p>\n<h2 id=\"About-Mathematica\">About Mathematica</h2>\n<p>Mathematica 11 could not be started after a freetype upgrade.</p>\n<p>When run in command line, it emits an error like <a href=\"https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/57948\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this</a>.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-8198000.html?sid=ab27c1ca8e1927691858595185e18284\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the gentoo forum site</a>.

梗概\n\n“七年之后的4月1日，在这里再次见面，约定好了！”\n\n失去了七年前记忆的Haruto，唯独记得这个不知何时何地、不知和谁定下的约定，为了赴约，也为了找回失去的记忆，Haruto时隔七年又回到了这个充满了<del>忘掉了的</del>回忆的小镇。\n\n<span class=\"spoiler\">妈妈临走时说的话好令人在意！</span>\n\n然而等着他的真相没有那么简单。\n\n在医院，他见到了过去的挚友：Riku和他的弟弟Takeru，活泼的女孩Saki和正反面的Honoka，在交谈中他得知与他交换约定的对象:Aoi，在七年前就已经由于自身所患的LMD病发病过世了。\n\n注：LMD是虚构的病名，并非什么Leptomeningeal Disease，不治之症倒是相同。\n\n然而真相没有那么简单，不过这件事的真相到最后才明了，可以说是最长的悬念<del>并没有</del>了。\n\n不知道从哪里弄到门卡复本（这个到最后也没解释）的Riku怀疑医院有放置LMD病人，见死不救的嫌疑，为了救他的LMD弟弟<span class=\"spoiler\">3d</span>决心潜入医院闭锁的档案室，Haruto也跟随他一起去寻找不为人知的那份，记录医院过去不正行为的档案。不幸触发了警报（这个警报必定触发），Haruto和Riku在黑暗中被人抓住，故事就此结束。\n\n<del>然而故事没那么简单，</del>当Haruto再次恢复意识时，他发现自己又回到了3月29日，来到小镇的第一天！\n\n出于<del>我的懒惰</del>减少剧透的原因，剧情梗概就到这里。\n\n当然，这个梗概也没这么简单。<span class=\"spoiler\">最后是happy end!为翻白了的自己后悔吧！明明都标了剧透了还要手滑！</span>\n\n本人其实是看着评论里说是不完美结局，想着玩一玩荡涤一下心灵的。不过这个游戏虽然<span class=\"spoiler\">见上</span>，不过感人还是感人的。\n\n## 特点\n\n主要是讲友情，为他人而死的价值观。\n\n还有。。。\n\n```\n█

verdict\n\n作为免费的，个人制作的游戏，《7年后等你》可以说是十分良心了。而且可以看出里面也融入了很多的心血。结果上，也给玩家带来了一次享受？话不说死以免下面有人喷我（不会有的！）。\n\n祝愿作者也能找到自己的幸福，幸せになってよ！（啊哈哈，太羞耻了）\n\n## 结语\n\n时间跳跃（本作可以具体到时间的循环=time loop）的要素其实在很多作品中都有出现，毕竟是人正常的欲望嘛。这之中做的比较有趣的像《Steins;Gate》、《Kagerou Days》（这是一首歌）这种，<span class=\"spoiler\">像后者也是双人玩家+拯救循环，像前者也是虽然每次循环结果不怎么样，但总是在向前迈进，而且也是在循环中种下了下一次循环的种子</span>。\n\n或许有人会想，没有meta吗，怎么可能会有！\n\n集合了time leap和meta、AI要素的《光之海的Apeiria》，说不定下一次会介绍这部作品（等我打完）。\n\n最后放个链接：\n\n[Itunes

Marionette -- Let's talk about Tiny Snow","lang":"en","label":"tiny snow review","date":"2019-06-17T03:19:06.000Z","_content":"\n\n## Intro\n\nA month or two ago, [this game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1002560/Tiny_Snow/) gained its fame through an unexpected way. In reply to an review criticizing the depiction being bad of how lovey dovey the duo are, the developer said: that's because ... well ... I myself haven't had a girlfriend.\n\nPersonally I feel a little sad for him. Although I might not be entitled to do so, since I am still single myself (fortunately I'm not too bothered by it). And also for his game. From now on when people talks about *Tiny Snow*, it will always be \"that game made by the poor beta male\" rather than \"a kawaii game, but tries to cover some serious topics\", while the latter somehow better describe this game as a game.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Plots\n\n> If you are made into loving someone, what will you do?\n\nThe story starts with the protagonist, an assistant of the professor, how adopted him since he was young, running away to a shabby wooden house in a snowy mountain to focus on the research. However, little Rong[^1], his clingy sister, also an adopted child of the professor, followed him into this uninhabited place. The two of them both have a feeling for each other, and this feeling grows untampered as the two live together in this sequestered small hut.\n\nHowever, the protagonist knows a secret, that he and his little sister are subjects of the professor's experiment. In this experiment, they are made into thinking the each other is the best fit. And that's what bugs the protagonist -- choosing to be with little Rong means that he succumbs to manipulation.\n\nBut the choice has to be made. To accept it, or resist it.\n\n## Are We Free?\n\nThe existence of free will has long been discussed and debated about, somehow even until today. Some argue that we have free will, others disagree.\n\nDeterminism is such a belief that everything is predetermined, and thus free will does not exist. Ideas of determinism includes Laplace's demon, an entity keeping track of everything and thus able to predict the future. But the demon is incompatible with Copenhagen's interpretation, so hopefully it will stay within the realm of imaginary. Einstein was unhappy with this thought, because in his view, God doesn't throw the dice.\n\nHowever, there's super-determinism, which states that everything is predetermined since the bigbang. This, unlike the demon, cannot be disproved. And this possibility can undermine the Bell test, which gained some popularity in 2016, and that's another story.\n\nThat kind of gives out a feeling that, our behaviors may be predetermined -- when we go to eat, what we think, the thought that we have a free will -- and we could do nothing to change them.\n\nBut does that really matter? What is the point in upsetting ourselves for no one's good? As long as things are good either way, it might be better to choose to believe in the one that we desire. For example, that we have free will.[^2] It's in a sense similar to Occam's razor. But the objectives are different: Occam's razor tries to make most people pleased, but this -- I'd call it tiny snow principle, if I have the right to name it -- favors ourselves than any other.\n\n## Your Love, or the True Love\n\nBut the dilemma in the game is a little more complicated. The protagonist and little Rong underwent medications unconsciously, which make them believe that each other is the destined.\n\nSo is our free will still free under outside manipulations?\n\nIt reminds me of a biased classifier. Assume we train a binary classifier that, given a person's health information, decides if they are infected with disease A. Suppose only an extreme minority, say 0.01%, has infected A, we will have a lot of negative cases, and insufficient positive ones. So the trained model can display biased behavior: it simply judges everyone as healthy, which is undesired.\n\nA deeper analysis on its cause may be seen in a textbook and I won't cover it here, but the point is, we have remedies for such unbalanced data. We can re-sample the data set to make it more balanced, or we can modify the output of the model to offset it. As long as we know it is biased, something can be done.\n\n*When we know we are not free, we are.*\n\n## Reality and Fiction\n\nAs the developer said himself, he hadn't been in a relationship, which makes the lovey-dovey part less convincing. But there are things that based on facts.\n\nIn a part, the professor is accused of conducting this *unethical* experiment by her fellow professors, she reputes it by revealing that they are themselves corrupt. For example, a professor demands one of his students to call him \"dad\", do daily chores for him, and witholds the student's graduation. This may sound outrageous, but is something that actually happened. A graduate student was abused by his advisor in the mentioned way, and he committed suicide in the end.\n\nYes, the story is not full of sunshine, I forgot to mention. It's more so in the small extra story \"Xue\" (lit. snow), where the female protagonist little Xue is assigned to a man who is psychologically disgusting, but physiologically alluring, due to the technology developed. She loathes the man so much, that when he talks, the only thing she heards is pig oinking. She tries to escape this nightmare, but the man wouldn't let it happen. He captures her, rapes her in order to impregnate her and thus continue his lineage, which is the only thing in his mind. There is no love. If there's anything, that would be hatred.\n\nBack to the topic. The professor is depicted as someone who gives no shit about others' opinion, and in a way prioritize the experiment over everything else, so it's actually a bit hard to extrapolate her motivation to accuse her fellow workers of hypocrisy. That's why I think this part is a bit contrived. Even if the author wants to discuss the dark side of the academia, which is a well-intended attempt to raise public attention, there may still be a better way for it to fit in the plots.\n\n## Short Review\n\nI don't rate any games, but I would say it is a *good* game. Not excellent, nor perfect, but anyway I'd like to recommend it.\n\nAdmittedly a lot needs improvement. For example, a significant part of the story is devoted to the professor's discursive preach, meanwhile the reporter is, in most times, not regarded as a real person with emotions and feelings, but only a tool to advance this preach.\n\nThese shortcomings apart, Tiny Snow's story surrounds an interesting as well as thought-provoking topic. This material vs mental conflict brings a tinge of philosophy to the work, and that's what I think makes this game special.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n[^1]: Rong means soft and fluffy in Chinese, or mushrooms as in Japanese.\n[^2]: The same applies to religions. It may sound heretic, but whether God exists is like a devil's proof: the lack of evidence supporting it doesn't lead to its non-existence. That means we can believe in God in some way.","source":"_posts/tinysnow.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Free Will of a Marionette -- Let's talk about Tiny Snow\ntags:\n  - commentary\n  - game\n  - sugaru miaki\n  - tiny snow\n  - free will\n  - literature\n  - koisuru kiseichuu\ncategory:\n  - commentary\nlang: en\nlabel: tiny snow review\ndate: 2019-06-16 22:19:06\n---\n\n\n## Intro\n\nA month or two ago, [this game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1002560/Tiny_Snow/) gained its fame through an unexpected way.

If there's need, I would add more to it, but there's no guarantee.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## What is it\n\n*Your Story* is a novel written by Sugaru Miaki, published last July. If you read *Three Days of Happiness*, that is one of his first works as a online writer.\n\nHe mainly writes boy-meets-girl story -- there are a lot of counterparts in MediaWorks Bunko[^2], where his previous works are published. If you've read *Kimi ga Tsukiyo ni Hikari Kagayaku*(lit. you shine in a night with moon) by Tetsuya Sano, the grand prize winner of Dengeki Novel Prize, it's one of those stories with the same topic. \n\nBy the way, I feel a little better about *Kimitsuki* than Sano's next novel *Kono Sekai ni \"i\" wo Komete*(lit. Fill this World with \"i\"). It's not that the \"i\" pun makes it sound like a joke. It really means something, so I guess it's OK. It's just, the writer supplied with his own experiences: one of his acquaintance, a wanna-be writer, committed suicide. He probably tried to find the answer to a question, that for whom am I writing? And the worries is projected right onto the protagonist, who stopped writing upon his childhood friend, and his earnest reader's death.\n\nThe main take here is that lightnovels from MediaWorks Bunko are different from the Dengeki ones -- they are more literature and less lightnovel. In detail, they are easier to read than literature, with more aesthetic value than lightnovels. They dubbed it *light literature*, and it fits well.\n\nThough it's a different publisher this time, *Your Story* shares the same features with other novels with that label. So if you keep a little more attention when reading, rather than just treat it as another lightnovel, you will enjoy this book a little more.\n\n## What it tells\n\nAs I said before, it is boy-meets-girl. But to be more precise, it is probably boy-misses-girl.\n\nThere are a young man and a woman having nothing. They meet each other. And then they lose each other. A little tragedy like this.\n\nA writer had some talk about tragedies:\n\n{% quote %}\n\nWhy makes a tragedy a tragedy? Because it is inevitable. And that lays the aesthetic foundation of tragedies. Why is Ancient Greek tragedies often related to fate? That's because they -- unlike us Easterners -- had much trust in the personalities of human, and of deities -- which are of humans in essence. So they in turn believed it is fate, rather than the evil in human personalities, that is the true, inevitable cause behind all tragedies. That's what makes them loveable.\n\n{% endquote %}\n\nI am not trying to argue about determining factors in Greek tragedies. But it helps us to categorize the reasons, and we can see both characteristic flaws, and fate take a part in it. She has a incurable and fatal disease, which is determined by nothing but fate. Both she and he have nothing in their past, but they have different attitudes towards it: she loves falsity, as it fills the blank in her heart; while he disgusts falsity, because it deprived him of his life. This decisive difference, makes them missing each other in the first part.\n\nHowever, like in his previous books, Miaki sometimes likes to attribute one's personality hugely to their background, family for instance. Like in *Koisuru Kiseichuu*(lit. parasites in love), the main charater grows mysophobia because of his mother. And the result is, it somehow brings a determinism tint to the story.\n\n## A Peek into it\n\nThe story starts itself with a poetic excerpt from *Cyrano de Bergerac*. But we can save it for now. Though the excerpt sheds light on the motif, or more probably, the motivation of the story, it itself doesn't tell anything. One can proclaim, \"caffe latte is great, and that's it\", but that's not why caffe latte tastes great. An explanation is meaningful only if there is something to explain.\n\n---\n\n> I have a childhood friend who I've never met.\n\nSo from the first sentence, we know that the story unfolds between \"I\" and the \"childhood friend\", and the main twist is that I've never met this friend.\n\nAnd this weird phenomenon is, as it turns out, due to the use of *mimories*, which is the word coined for artificial, false memories[^1]. And no operations are needed to apply it, infusing some nanobots will do the job. So it's as easy as having a cup of cocktail -- go to the place, give an order, and drink it. The only difference would be how we call them -- a bartender for one making cocktail, while a mimory engineer for one weaving mimories.\n\nChihiro Amagai suffers from parents since his childhood, who indulge themselves in mimories, and weasel reality at their best. As said in the following:\n\n{% quote %}\n\nWhen they need to take a trip, they would buy mimories of a trip instead. When they need to throw a party, they would buy mimories of a party instead. When they need to have a wedding ceremony, they would buy mimories of a wedding ceremony instead. By such kind of parents, I was brought up.\n\n{% endquote %}\n\nThat makes Chihiro's childhood a rather miserable one. And as he dislikes his parents, he disgusts at the use of mimories.\n\nHe wants to forget this past of nothing, so he decided to erase his memories. However, by mistake, instead of forgetting his past full of nothing, he is filled with happy memories with Touka Natsunagi, a nonexistent childhood friend. And he inevitably falls in love with this girl, to the extent he actually sees her, and can't help recalling mimories with her. He wishes that she is real so much, that he mistakes another one for her.\n\nBut another self in Chihiro denies all of this. \"Isn't it so pathetic, that the most beautiful memories I have are just another one's made-up stories?\" \"Love is for those who do exist.\" And she does not exist, it is just \"a illusion of the summer\".\n\nHe is offered to choice to remove this fictional memory, which is easy as drinking the powder. But he hesitates to take the step. He tells himself, \"it's not the right place\", when he gets to the shrine to perform this ritual, he finds out that \"I definitely can't drink it in such bad weather\".\n\nAnd the last strike comes. When he returns to his apartment from the shrine, he surprisedly find Touka, who doesn't exist and shouldn't exist, is opening the door next to him.\n\n> The illusion of the summer still continues.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n[^1]: From a translation of the novel. There is some kanji play in the word *gioku*. It has two kanji: *gi*, and *oku*. There are two kanji pronunced *gi* in Japanese, but have different meanings: one for \"false, untrue\", and another for \"artificial\". *Gioku* originally uses the former kanji, which is somewhat negative, so there is a movement to replace with the latter, which is more neutral. On the other hand, *oku* directly comes from *kioku*, which means memory in Japanese.\n\n[^2]: Japanese publishers often use labels to categorize their books. For example, *Shogakukan* has labels like *Gagaga Bunko* and *Lululu Bunko* , the former is used for books targetting boys, and the latter for girls. *Dengeki Bunko* and *MediaWorks Bunko* are both labels of the publisher ASCII Media Works.\n*Bunko* only indicates the book is smaller in size(A6, to be exact), and there are labels without this suffix.","source":"_posts/your-story.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 'Let''s Talk about Your Story -- Kimi no Hanashi, part 1'\ntags:\n  - lightnovel\n  - literature\n  - kimi no hanashi\n  - sugaru miaki\ncategory:\n  - writing\nlang: en\ndate: 2019-04-18 12:42:19\n---\n\n\n## Forewords\n\nI try limiting the words by just telling just a part of the book in this post.

There is some kanji play in the word *gioku*. It has two kanji: *gi*, and *oku*. There are two kanji pronunced *gi* in Japanese, but have different meanings: one for \"false, untrue\", and another for \"artificial\". *Gioku* originally uses the former kanji, which is somewhat negative, so there is a movement to replace with the latter, which is more neutral. On the other hand, *oku* directly comes from *kioku*, which means memory in Japanese.\n\n[^2]: Japanese publishers often use labels to categorize their books. For example, *Shogakukan* has labels like *Gagaga Bunko* and *Lululu Bunko* , the former is used for books targetting boys, and the latter for girls. *Dengeki Bunko* and *MediaWorks Bunko* are both labels of the publisher ASCII Media Works.\n*Bunko* only indicates the book is smaller in size(A6, to be exact), and there are labels without this suffix.","slug":"your-story","published":1,"updated":"2020-04-01T07:12:23.257Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"ck8h06r7t007sbfvidiqkcz6i","content":"<h2 id=\"Forewords\">Forewords</h2>\n<p>I try limiting the words by just telling just a part of the book in this post.

And that lays the aesthetic foundation of tragedies. Why is Ancient Greek tragedies often related to fate? That’s because they – unlike us Easterners – had much trust in the personalities of human, and of deities – which are of humans in essence. So they in turn believed it is fate, rather than the evil in human personalities, that is the true, inevitable cause behind all tragedies. That’s what makes them loveable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am not trying to argue about determining factors in Greek tragedies. But it helps us to categorize the reasons, and we can see both characteristic flaws, and fate take a part in it. She has a incurable and fatal disease, which is determined by nothing but fate. Both she and he have nothing in their past, but they have different attitudes towards it: she loves falsity, as it fills the blank in her heart; while he disgusts falsity, because it deprived him of his life. This decisive difference, makes them missing each other in the first part.</p>\n<p>However, like in his previous books, Miaki sometimes likes to attribute one’s personality hugely to their background, family for instance. Like in <em>Koisuru Kiseichuu</em>(lit. parasites in love), the main charater grows mysophobia because of his mother. And the result is, it somehow brings a determinism tint to the story.</p>\n<h2 id=\"A-Peek-into-it\">A Peek into it</h2>\n<p>The story starts itself with a poetic excerpt from <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em>.

However, it has nothing to do with that game.\n\n{% alert warning %}\nThe translation of Japaneses words are done with best effort, in another word, there is no any kind of guarantee that the translation is official or consistent with the official one.\n{% endalert %}\n\n{% alert warning %}\nThis article contains spoilers, which may harm or even completely ruin your experiences, here's a non-exhaustive list:\n*Hikari no Umi no Apeiria(Apeiria of the Sea of Landscape)*\n*Steins;Gate*\n*Eiyuu Densetsu Sen no Kiseki(Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel)*\n*Planetarian ~ Chiisana Hoshi no Yume*\n*Newton to Ringo no Ki(Newton and the Apple Tree)*\n*Eden* *(spoiler: it is not spoiled)\n\nProgress with heed.\n{% endalert %}\n\n## Preface\n\nThis post does not contain what you'd expect from a typical game review -- the overall plot, the execution, the voice casts and so on, because it is kinda lame to write something that is already on the Internet, especially for a year-old game like Apeiria(although I myself is the reason why this post is delayed for half a year).\n\nSo instead, the post focuses on elements and ideas, either central or peripheral to the game, and expands these concepts further. This strategy makes the post a little out of focus, and here's another reason for it: the game is in a sense mediocre, because it does not exceeds one's expectation. \n\nI don't mean the game is bad. On the contrary, *Apeiria* is a good combination of popular concepts and has a capturing story. After all, if the game is really not good enough, I wouldn't even bother to post an article about it, let alone go through iterations in this six months. The point is, however great the game is, *Apeiria* is just a galgame, nothing more, nothing less.\n\nIt is hard to define what makes an art piece unique, but for a game, drawing moustache on character's face and claiming the originality would be unique for the blatant copyright infringement. For a game, it could have great arts and music, humanly characters, a catching plot, or a thought-provoking theme. Kikiyama's free game *Yume Nikki(Dream Diary)*, for example, features exploring exotic scenes with an unrealistic art style, whereas *The Last of Us*, an action game by Naughty Dogs, portrays humanity in a postapocalyptic world. And that's one of the reasons why they receive acclaims from the fans.\n\nThat being said, people's mileages can greatly vary, and there's no universal standard for good or bad games. So this post is not about judging whether a game is good or not, but just a peek into the core of the game.\n\n## No Sense Online\n\n> Note: it comes from *Only Sense Online*, an online lightnovel by Aroha Zachou(literally Chairman Aloha) later published in print. AFAIK this lightnovel does not feature OreTueee.\n\nThe story of *Apeiria* happens in 2035, and people profit from the highly developed VR technology and AI research. Reiichi Kirishima, works together with his friends to build the VRMMORPG *Second*. The second is a fantasy world of sword and magic. One may suspect fantasy makes up most of the game, just as Reki Kawahara's lightnovel *Sword Art Online*, and most online novels do. However, the story puts emphasis on both the real world and the virtual one. But the best part is, the two seemingly contradicting themes are tactfully merged in the end of the game.\n\nBack to the fantasy world. Usually to make a party, we need members of these sorts:\n\n1. Short- and/or mid-range attackers. They are usually deployed to defend the party members behind. Examples are thieves, swordsmans, lancers, and fighters. There should better be a tank to take the damage.\n2. Long-range attackers or scouts. They can discover enemies early, leaving enough time for preparation. Their attacks won't be countered by short-range enemies. Archers, for example, belong to this category.\n3. Mages. If physical attack and magical attack are largely different in ways of effects and costs, then mages are needed to ensure a more comprehensive scope of attack.\n4. Healers or supporters. Their importance is never overemphasized.\n\nTake Falcom's *Legend of Heroes: Trails of the Cold Steel I* as a motivating example, we have:\n\n1. Short-/mid-range: Rean(tachi), Laura(double-handed sword), Fie(dagger/gun), Jusis(knight sword), Gaius(spear)\n2. Long-range: Alisa(bow), Machias(shotgun), Eliot(staff), Emma(staff)\n3. Mages: Emma, Eliot\n4. Healer: Eliot, Emma\n\nIn this game everyone is able to use arts(what magic is called in this game), therefore the main difference between mages and others is that mages have higher magic attack/defence stats. So Eliot and Emma are not required as mages(though they are required as healers).\n\nTrails of the Cold Steel allows only four characters in the battle, with two substitute members, there are at most 6 members in the party most of the time. Let's see how Falcom arranges the party in each chapter to make sure it is balanced:\n\n1. Rean(S), Alisa(L), Eliot(H), Laura(S)\n2. Rean(S), Emma(H), Fie(S), Machias(L), Jusis(S)\n3. Rean(S), Gaius(S), Jusis(S), Alisa(L), Emma(H)\n4. Rean(S), Laura(S), Fie(S), Machias(L), Eliot(H)\n5. Rean(S), Laura(S), Jusis(S), Emma(H), Millium(S)\n6. Rean(S), Alisa(L), Eliot(S), Machias(L), Fie(S), Crow(S)\n\nThough there's another system restricting the selection of members: there are four types of normal attack damage: slash, pierce, thrust, strike. Normal attacks from different characters have varied affinities to these types. For instance, Rean's tachi attack has a high slash affinity, while Laura's affinity to both slash and strike is high. And different enemies can be easily unbalanced by different types of attack damages. So the damage throughput could be increased by  using the right person to attack the enemies, leading to more unbalancing and link attacks. Though the system is marginal since the bosses can hardly be unbalanced(they don't have this kind of weak point), the affinities of the characters are carefully arranged to make sure all four types are covered in the above party setups.\n\nHowever, in Apeiria, we see an unprecedented bias of party member roles. The constitution of the party is like this:\n\n1. Reiichi: short/mid-range attacker, main damage output, can revive himself and buff teammates\n2. Miu: sniper and healer. So roughly speaking, she's Ana from *Overwatch*, while being a tsundere younger sister.\n3. Kuon: swordswoman, tank(she have a spell to call out an inpenetrable shield)\n4. Mashiro: thief, able to exchange money for rare items\n5. Apeiria: mage, persumably a DPS(second to Reiichi), unavailable most of the times.\n\nAs we can see Reiichi is ridiculously overpowered -- he himself is a whole team. I guess it is probably due to the story. If my memory serves me right, the party is like the following in different times:\n\n1. Reiichi, Miu, Kuon, Mashiro, Apeiria\n2. Reiichi, Miu\n3. Reiichi, Kuon\n4. Reiichi, Mashiro\n5. Reiichi, Miu, Kuon, Mashiro\n\nNanami and whatever are taking up much less a role, so they aren't counted. Discussion about them can be left to the post about the game's spinoff *Casablanca no Kishi(Knights of Casablanca)*, if there is one.\n\nGiven this plot requirement, the usual party makeup does not make any sense, because Reiichi will have no chance of survival, turning the *Second* into souls-like games, and *Apeiria* into *Re:zero*. Powering up the heroines could be a good idea, but that will render the last fight, a one-on-one fight with the last boss unimpressive.\n\nThis kind of unbalanced protagonist is mushrooming in lightnovels these years. With the uprise of coarse grained net novels, the use of such template is hitting new high. Let's yell out some of the catch phrases:\n\n*Shuujinkou saikyou*(protagonist the mightiest)!\n\n*Ore tueeee*(I'm so stroooong)!\n\nSuch settings bring about some benefits. One of them is that the story can always be kept under control. There's no need for ex machina, because the overpowered protagonist themself is the ex machina. Another is that a group of readers are usually happy about it. Admittedly I was one of them.\n\n## Apeiria of Love and Desire\n\n> Note: it comes from *Aiyoku no Eustia*. *Ai* means tarnish rather than love, while *yoku* means wings instead of desire.\n\nIn August's visual novel *Aiyoku no Eustia*, we have multiple routes, from Ellis the pharmacist to Eustia, the main heroine in the story. Unlike other galgames, in *Eustia*, the common route does not branch to personal routes at the same time. It first has a branch off to Ellis' route, then Fione's, on and on, and in the end Eustia's. Such a structure allows huge savings, since one thing in one route needn't be reintroduced in another. Moreover, it makes all routes sequentially related, so the player can regard the story as a well-structured whole, rather than 5 separate ones.\n\nAnother visual novel created by Laplacian, *Newton and the Apple Tree*, has the same flow of story. However, the game forces the player to go into Ravi's route once before progressing to the Japanese, the maid, and Alice.\n\nHowever, it is not as simple as spreading out to personal routes sequentially. There should be key events to set the backgrounds of the personal routes apart. In Nitroplus' adventure (text) game *Steins;Gate*, the D-mail is the key. If Rintarou sends the D-mail to Firis, the whole landscape of Akihabara will not be the heaven of otakus, but still a street of electronics. Therefore, the common route before and after this branch into Ferris' route differs significantly.\n\n*Apeiria* is also a galgame that has such a structure. However, it integrates all routes into one. As a side-effect, choices are eliminated, and we have a truly linear storyline. But here comes the problem: how can we avoid conflicts of different routes? Even we can manipulate the protagonist's feelings for the heroines, we cannot simply take things in the previous route as unhappened.\n\nTo resolve the conflict, Silky's Plus Dolce resorts to the good old time leap: if we can revert to the time before the personal route begins, then everything works perfectly. Therefore, in the end of routes the protag leaps to one year before the current time, losing almost all his memories, including the ones with the heroine.\n\nHowever, there is no elixir, and the seemingly powerful time traveling has its side-effects, that is the time paradox. In *Steins;Gate*, to avoid the time paradox being happening, Rintarou has to stab Kurisu while avoiding bumping into his past self, when he goes back in time to save Kurisu. Sorry, but my poor wording makes it sounds a little silly.\n\n*Apeiria* goes further than that: rather than not touching the paradox, it provides a new theory to get over it. The theory states it is not the case what one does now has no impact on the past. When we travel to the past, the future is not undone: it affects now so that everythin will converge to what has happened in the future.\n\nLike this one, there are many theories presented in *Apeiria* about time, causality and so on. Just like the *Koujin Nanase* part of manga *Kyokou Suiri(In/Spectre)*, although every theory, in itself, is unsound, it has its reasonable parts. And in the showdown, all rational parts are combined to make the final, sound theory.\n\n## Mechanic Princess in the Dying World\n\n> Note: it comes from the light novel *Kakeyuku Toshi no Kikai Tsukihime*, wherein a robot girl meets her end.\n\nEveryone knows an awful lot about the greatness of AI, but much less about its correct use. Fortunately, we have Silky's Plus Dolce to point out the right way: to make one's own girlfriends.\n\nIt is a reiterated theme - there are already works about having android girls or something like that as protagonists or heroines. In manga *Mahoromatic*, the main heroine Mahoro is a female android, previously soldier, who comes to Misato's house after knowing she has only a year left. Visual Arts Key's visual novel *Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet* features Yumemi Hoshino, a female robot narrator in a discarded planetarium. In the anime series *Plastic Memories*, we have android Isla(Aira) working with Tsukasa, the protagonist, to retrieve androids that are near the end of their life.\n\nIt seems not really good -- they nurtured a stereotype about androids and robots -- they are powerful but vunerable, they have short lifespan, they have difficulties understand human emotions, so on and so forth.\n\nAnd the real bad thing is that Apeiria, one of the main heroine, and the center of the whole story, does not at all fall out of these stereotypes.\n\n* Power: she hacks tens of billions of computers around the world to make her Apeiria Network.\n* Vulnerability: she has not once successfully repelled Thinker's virus attack. And when the Apeiria Network is hacked, she cannot disconnect herself from the network to avoid being disabled.\n* Short lifespan: near her own route, she has only one year to live(it's Mahoro!)\n\n## Exception\n\n> Note: it comes from the movie *Inception*, maybe.\n\nTired and bored after a day's work, we may want to escape the real world, and embrace a virtual one. So one may imagine a switch mechanism for it: switch on, and we're in the realm of imagination, and off, back to the real world.\n\nBut such a kind of mechanism overlooks the interplay of this two worlds. Usually one playing a game is aware of its virtual nature, and is not separated from the outside. Take *Ready Player One* for example, control of the character in game is also affected by the lost of balance in the real world. So the virtual world can be greatly influenced by the real world, but it is often not the same the way around.\n\nWith this asymmetry taken into consideration, a layered structure seems better to express this kind of relationship. Here we adopt the idea of a stack. The virtual domain is on the top, while the reality is in the bottom. The virtual world dominates our feelings when present, but we fall back to earth upon exiting the imaginary.\n\nSo the reality-virtuality dichotomy can be expressed by a stack of size 2, let's call it world stack from now. The real world is the first element of the world stack, and also the only element if we're in reality. But if we dive into the virtual world, like OASIS, then we push the game onto the stack, and there's two elements: the virtual world on top of the real world.\n\nAnd it is easy to extend the world stack to allow more than 2 elements.\n\nIn a chapter of Douglas Hofstadter's book *Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid*, Achilles and the tortoise travels in and out Escher's works by drinking blue and red phials. The travelling is done in a similar manner: going deeper into prints is like the push an item onto the stack, while going out out of the piece of artwork is like popping elements of the stack. And the world we are directly feeling is the top element of the stack.\n\nThough it bears resemblance to the stack data structure, the world stack has a definitive difference: we do not know how many elements are in the stack at any time. So here's the problem: how can we know if the top element of the world stack is the real world? In other words, how can we tell if the world we're right in real or not?\n\nWe can check this by popping out elements, if there's nothing to pop, then the world stack is empty, and the last world we popped is the real one. But note that popping out real world usually means one's death. One never knows if the red pill is authentic before he washes it down. So we do not know if the current world we're living is real, the only thing we know is since the real world is at the bottom, if we find out the current world is virtual, we can always pop out of it without getting ourselves killed.\n\nBut the safety to pop out does not mean it is doable. For example, it is claimed that people in heaven never dies. So people are not able to access the world beyond heaven, just like the girls cannot come out of the screen.\n\nTo solve this problem, *Apeiria* introduces a world structure similar to the stack model, but is different in its essence. In the game, the top and the bottom of the stack are connected, therefore the way in becomes the way out.\n\n## Verdict\n\n*Apeiria* is a interesting combination of popular topics -- AI, virtual reality -- on the good old basis of Sci-Fi and fantasy. Unlike in *Sword Art Online*, where one is constant aware the world's nature, *Apeiria* weaves a story across the borderline of reality and fantasy, which makes it capturing and different.","source":"_posts/sunful-sea.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Lightful Sea - Hikari no Umi no Apeiria Review\ntags:\n  - commentary\n  - game\n  - AI\n  - time loop\ncategory:\n  - commentary\ndate: 2018-07-16 15:31:33\nlang: en\nlabel: apeiria review\n---\n\n\nThe title comes from *Sunless Sea*, an adventure game where the player explore the dark sea of unknown.

Kikiyama's free game *Yume Nikki(Dream Diary)*, for example, features exploring exotic scenes with an unrealistic art style, whereas *The Last of Us*, an action game by Naughty Dogs, portrays humanity in a postapocalyptic world. And that's one of the reasons why they receive acclaims from the fans.\n\nThat being said, people's mileages can greatly vary, and there's no universal standard for good or bad games. So this post is not about judging whether a game is good or not, but just a peek into the core of the game.\n\n## No Sense Online\n\n> Note: it comes from *Only Sense Online*, an online lightnovel by Aroha Zachou(literally Chairman Aloha) later published in print. AFAIK this lightnovel does not feature OreTueee.\n\nThe story of *Apeiria* happens in 2035, and people profit from the highly developed VR technology and AI research. Reiichi Kirishima, works together with his friends to build the VRMMORPG *Second*. The second is a fantasy world of sword and magic. One may suspect fantasy makes up most of the game, just as Reki Kawahara's lightnovel *Sword Art Online*, and most online novels do. However, the story puts emphasis on both the real world and the virtual one. But the best part is, the two seemingly contradicting themes are tactfully merged in the end of the game.\n\nBack to the fantasy world. Usually to make a party, we need members of these sorts:\n\n1. Short- and/or mid-range attackers. They are usually deployed to defend the party members behind. Examples are thieves, swordsmans, lancers, and fighters. There should better be a tank to take the damage.\n2. Long-range attackers or scouts. They can discover enemies early, leaving enough time for preparation. Their attacks won't be countered by short-range enemies. Archers, for example, belong to this category.\n3. Mages. If physical attack and magical attack are largely different in ways of effects and costs, then mages are needed to ensure a more comprehensive scope of attack.\n4. Healers or supporters. Their importance is never overemphasized.\n\nTake Falcom's *Legend of Heroes: Trails of the Cold Steel I* as a motivating example, we have:\n\n1. Short-/mid-range: Rean(tachi), Laura(double-handed sword), Fie(dagger/gun), Jusis(knight sword), Gaius(spear)\n2. Long-range: Alisa(bow), Machias(shotgun), Eliot(staff), Emma(staff)\n3. Mages: Emma, Eliot\n4. Healer: Eliot, Emma\n\nIn this game everyone is able to use arts(what magic is called in this game), therefore the main difference between mages and others is that mages have higher magic attack/defence stats. So Eliot and Emma are not required as mages(though they are required as healers).\n\nTrails of the Cold Steel allows only four characters in the battle, with two substitute members, there are at most 6 members in the party most of the time. Let's see how Falcom arranges the party in each chapter to make sure it is balanced:\n\n1. Rean(S), Alisa(L), Eliot(H), Laura(S)\n2. Rean(S), Emma(H), Fie(S), Machias(L), Jusis(S)\n3. Rean(S), Gaius(S), Jusis(S), Alisa(L), Emma(H)\n4. Rean(S), Laura(S), Fie(S), Machias(L), Eliot(H)\n5. Rean(S), Laura(S), Jusis(S), Emma(H), Millium(S)\n6. Rean(S), Alisa(L), Eliot(S), Machias(L), Fie(S), Crow(S)\n\nThough there's another system restricting the selection of members: there are four types of normal attack damage: slash, pierce, thrust, strike. Normal attacks from different characters have varied affinities to these types. For instance, Rean's tachi attack has a high slash affinity, while Laura's affinity to both slash and strike is high. And different enemies can be easily unbalanced by different types of attack damages. So the damage throughput could be increased by  using the right person to attack the enemies, leading to more unbalancing and link attacks. Though the system is marginal since the bosses can hardly be unbalanced(they don't have this kind of weak point), the affinities of the characters are carefully arranged to make sure all four types are covered in the above party setups.\n\nHowever, in Apeiria, we see an unprecedented bias of party member roles. The constitution of the party is like this:\n\n1. Reiichi: short/mid-range attacker, main damage output, can revive himself and buff teammates\n2. Miu: sniper and healer. So roughly speaking, she's Ana from *Overwatch*, while being a tsundere younger sister.\n3. Kuon: swordswoman, tank(she have a spell to call out an inpenetrable shield)\n4. Mashiro: thief, able to exchange money for rare items\n5. Apeiria: mage, persumably a DPS(second to Reiichi), unavailable most of the times.\n\nAs we can see Reiichi is ridiculously overpowered -- he himself is a whole team. I guess it is probably due to the story. If my memory serves me right, the party is like the following in different times:\n\n1. Reiichi, Miu, Kuon, Mashiro, Apeiria\n2. Reiichi, Miu\n3. Reiichi, Kuon\n4. Reiichi, Mashiro\n5. Reiichi, Miu, Kuon, Mashiro\n\nNanami and whatever are taking up much less a role, so they aren't counted. Discussion about them can be left to the post about the game's spinoff *Casablanca no Kishi(Knights of Casablanca)*, if there is one.\n\nGiven this plot requirement, the usual party makeup does not make any sense, because Reiichi will have no chance of survival, turning the *Second* into souls-like games, and *Apeiria* into *Re:zero*. Powering up the heroines could be a good idea, but that will render the last fight, a one-on-one fight with the last boss unimpressive.\n\nThis kind of unbalanced protagonist is mushrooming in lightnovels these years. With the uprise of coarse grained net novels, the use of such template is hitting new high. Let's yell out some of the catch phrases:\n\n*Shuujinkou saikyou*(protagonist the mightiest)!\n\n*Ore tueeee*(I'm so stroooong)!\n\nSuch settings bring about some benefits. One of them is that the story can always be kept under control. There's no need for ex machina, because the overpowered protagonist themself is the ex machina. Another is that a group of readers are usually happy about it. Admittedly I was one of them.\n\n## Apeiria of Love and Desire\n\n> Note: it comes from *Aiyoku no Eustia*. *Ai* means tarnish rather than love, while *yoku* means wings instead of desire.\n\nIn August's visual novel *Aiyoku no Eustia*, we have multiple routes, from Ellis the pharmacist to Eustia, the main heroine in the story. Unlike other galgames, in *Eustia*, the common route does not branch to personal routes at the same time. It first has a branch off to Ellis' route, then Fione's, on and on, and in the end Eustia's. Such a structure allows huge savings, since one thing in one route needn't be reintroduced in another. Moreover, it makes all routes sequentially related, so the player can regard the story as a well-structured whole, rather than 5 separate ones.\n\nAnother visual novel created by Laplacian, *Newton and the Apple Tree*, has the same flow of story. However, the game forces the player to go into Ravi's route once before progressing to the Japanese, the maid, and Alice.\n\nHowever, it is not as simple as spreading out to personal routes sequentially. There should be key events to set the backgrounds of the personal routes apart. In Nitroplus' adventure (text) game *Steins;Gate*, the D-mail is the key. If Rintarou sends the D-mail to Firis, the whole landscape of Akihabara will not be the heaven of otakus, but still a street of electronics. Therefore, the common route before and after this branch into Ferris' route differs significantly.\n\n*Apeiria* is also a galgame that has such a structure. However, it integrates all routes into one. As a side-effect, choices are eliminated, and we have a truly linear storyline. But here comes the problem: how can we avoid conflicts of different routes? Even we can manipulate the protagonist's feelings for the heroines, we cannot simply take things in the previous route as unhappened.\n\nTo resolve the conflict, Silky's Plus Dolce resorts to the good old time leap: if we can revert to the time before the personal route begins, then everything works perfectly. Therefore, in the end of routes the protag leaps to one year before the current time, losing almost all his memories, including the ones with the heroine.\n\nHowever, there is no elixir, and the seemingly powerful time traveling has its side-effects, that is the time paradox. In *Steins;Gate*, to avoid the time paradox being happening, Rintarou has to stab Kurisu while avoiding bumping into his past self, when he goes back in time to save Kurisu. Sorry, but my poor wording makes it sounds a little silly.\n\n*Apeiria* goes further than that: rather than not touching the paradox, it provides a new theory to get over it. The theory states it is not the case what one does now has no impact on the past. When we travel to the past, the future is not undone: it affects now so that everythin will converge to what has happened in the future.\n\nLike this one, there are many theories presented in *Apeiria* about time, causality and so on. Just like the *Koujin Nanase* part of manga *Kyokou Suiri(In/Spectre)*, although every theory, in itself, is unsound, it has its reasonable parts. And in the showdown, all rational parts are combined to make the final, sound theory.\n\n## Mechanic Princess in the Dying World\n\n> Note: it comes from the light novel *Kakeyuku Toshi no Kikai Tsukihime*, wherein a robot girl meets her end.\n\nEveryone knows an awful lot about the greatness of AI, but much less about its correct use. Fortunately, we have Silky's Plus Dolce to point out the right way: to make one's own girlfriends.\n\nIt is a reiterated theme - there are already works about having android girls or something like that as protagonists or heroines. In manga *Mahoromatic*, the main heroine Mahoro is a female android, previously soldier, who comes to Misato's house after knowing she has only a year left. Visual Arts Key's visual novel *Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet* features Yumemi Hoshino, a female robot narrator in a discarded planetarium. In the anime series *Plastic Memories*, we have android Isla(Aira) working with Tsukasa, the protagonist, to retrieve androids that are near the end of their life.\n\nIt seems not really good -- they nurtured a stereotype about androids and robots -- they are powerful but vunerable, they have short lifespan, they have difficulties understand human emotions, so on and so forth.\n\nAnd the real bad thing is that Apeiria, one of the main heroine, and the center of the whole story, does not at all fall out of these stereotypes.\n\n* Power: she hacks tens of billions of computers around the world to make her Apeiria Network.\n* Vulnerability: she has not once successfully repelled Thinker's virus attack. And when the Apeiria Network is hacked, she cannot disconnect herself from the network to avoid being disabled.\n* Short lifespan: near her own route, she has only one year to live(it's Mahoro!)\n\n## Exception\n\n> Note: it comes from the movie *Inception*, maybe.\n\nTired and bored after a day's work, we may want to escape the real world, and embrace a virtual one. So one may imagine a switch mechanism for it: switch on, and we're in the realm of imagination, and off, back to the real world.\n\nBut such a kind of mechanism overlooks the interplay of this two worlds. Usually one playing a game is aware of its virtual nature, and is not separated from the outside. Take *Ready Player One* for example, control of the character in game is also affected by the lost of balance in the real world. So the virtual world can be greatly influenced by the real world, but it is often not the same the way around.\n\nWith this asymmetry taken into consideration, a layered structure seems better to express this kind of relationship. Here we adopt the idea of a stack. The virtual domain is on the top, while the reality is in the bottom. The virtual world dominates our feelings when present, but we fall back to earth upon exiting the imaginary.\n\nSo the reality-virtuality dichotomy can be expressed by a stack of size 2, let's call it world stack from now. The real world is the first element of the world stack, and also the only element if we're in reality. But if we dive into the virtual world, like OASIS, then we push the game onto the stack, and there's two elements: the virtual world on top of the real world.\n\nAnd it is easy to extend the world stack to allow more than 2 elements.\n\nIn a chapter of Douglas Hofstadter's book *Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid*, Achilles and the tortoise travels in and out Escher's works by drinking blue and red phials. The travelling is done in a similar manner: going deeper into prints is like the push an item onto the stack, while going out out of the piece of artwork is like popping elements of the stack. And the world we are directly feeling is the top element of the stack.\n\nThough it bears resemblance to the stack data structure, the world stack has a definitive difference: we do not know how many elements are in the stack at any time. So here's the problem: how can we know if the top element of the world stack is the real world? In other words, how can we tell if the world we're right in real or not?\n\nWe can check this by popping out elements, if there's nothing to pop, then the world stack is empty, and the last world we popped is the real one. But note that popping out real world usually means one's death. One never knows if the red pill is authentic before he washes it down. So we do not know if the current world we're living is real, the only thing we know is since the real world is at the bottom, if we find out the current world is virtual, we can always pop out of it without getting ourselves killed.\n\nBut the safety to pop out does not mean it is doable. For example, it is claimed that people in heaven never dies. So people are not able to access the world beyond heaven, just like the girls cannot come out of the screen.\n\nTo solve this problem, *Apeiria* introduces a world structure similar to the stack model, but is different in its essence. In the game, the top and the bottom of the stack are connected, therefore the way in becomes the way out.\n\n## Verdict\n\n*Apeiria* is a interesting combination of popular topics -- AI, virtual reality -- on the good old basis of Sci-Fi and fantasy. Unlike in *Sword Art Online*, where one is constant aware the world's nature, *Apeiria* weaves a story across the borderline of reality and fantasy, which makes it capturing and different.","slug":"sunful-sea","published":1,"updated":"2020-04-01T07:12:23.246Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"ck8h06r7u007vbfvia7o0efr9","content":"<p>The title comes from <em>Sunless Sea</em>, an adventure game where the player explore the dark sea of unknown.

Unlike other galgames, in <em>Eustia</em>, the common route does not branch to personal routes at the same time. It first has a branch off to Ellis’ route, then Fione’s, on and on, and in the end Eustia’s. Such a structure allows huge savings, since one thing in one route needn’t be reintroduced in another. Moreover, it makes all routes sequentially related, so the player can regard the story as a well-structured whole, rather than 5 separate ones.</p>\n<p>Another visual novel created by Laplacian, <em>Newton and the Apple Tree</em>, has the same flow of story. However, the game forces the player to go into Ravi’s route once before progressing to the Japanese, the maid, and Alice.</p>\n<p>However, it is not as simple as spreading out to personal routes sequentially. There should be key events to set the backgrounds of the personal routes apart. In Nitroplus’ adventure (text) game <em>Steins;Gate</em>, the D-mail is the key. If Rintarou sends the D-mail to Firis, the whole landscape of Akihabara will not be the heaven of otakus, but still a street of electronics. Therefore, the common route before and after this branch into Ferris’ route differs significantly.</p>\n<p><em>Apeiria</em> is also a galgame that has such a structure. However, it integrates all routes into one. As a side-effect, choices are eliminated, and we have a truly linear storyline. But here comes the problem: how can we avoid conflicts of different routes? Even we can manipulate the protagonist’s feelings for the heroines, we cannot simply take things in the previous route as unhappened.</p>\n<p>To resolve the conflict, Silky’s Plus Dolce resorts to the good old time leap: if we can revert to the time before the personal route begins, then everything works perfectly. Therefore, in the end of routes the protag leaps to one year before the current time, losing almost all his memories, including the ones with the heroine.</p>\n<p>However, there is no elixir, and the seemingly powerful time traveling has its side-effects, that is the time paradox. In <em>Steins;Gate</em>, to avoid the time paradox being happening, Rintarou has to stab Kurisu while avoiding bumping into his past self, when he goes back in time to save Kurisu. Sorry, but my poor wording makes it sounds a little silly.</p>\n<p><em>Apeiria</em> goes further than that: rather than not touching the paradox, it provides a new theory to get over it. The theory states it is not the case what one does now has no impact on the past. When we travel to the past, the future is not undone: it affects now so that everythin will converge to what has happened in the future.</p>\n<p>Like this one, there are many theories presented in <em>Apeiria</em> about time, causality and so on. Just like the <em>Koujin Nanase</em> part of manga <em>Kyokou Suiri(In/Spectre)</em>, although every theory, in itself, is unsound, it has its reasonable parts. And in the showdown, all rational parts are combined to make the final, sound theory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Mechanic-Princess-in-the-Dying-World\">Mechanic Princess in the Dying World</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: it comes from the light novel <em>Kakeyuku Toshi no Kikai Tsukihime</em>, wherein a robot girl meets her end.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Everyone knows an awful lot about the greatness of AI, but much less about its correct use. Fortunately, we have Silky’s Plus Dolce to point out the right way: to make one’s own girlfriends.</p>\n<p>It is a reiterated theme - there are already works about having android girls or something like that as protagonists or heroines. In manga <em>Mahoromatic</em>, the main heroine Mahoro is a female android, previously soldier, who comes to Misato’s house after knowing she has only a year left. Visual Arts Key’s visual novel <em>Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet</em> features Yumemi Hoshino, a female robot narrator in a discarded planetarium. In the anime series <em>Plastic Memories</em>, we have android Isla(Aira) working with Tsukasa, the protagonist, to retrieve androids that are near the end of their life.</p>\n<p>It seems not really good – they nurtured a stereotype about androids and robots – they are powerful but vunerable, they have short lifespan, they have difficulties understand human emotions, so on and so forth.</p>\n<p>And the real bad thing is that Apeiria, one of the main heroine, and the center of the whole story, does not at all fall out of these stereotypes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Power: she hacks tens of billions of computers around the world to make her Apeiria Network.</li>\n<li>Vulnerability: she has not once successfully repelled Thinker’s virus attack. And when the Apeiria Network is hacked, she cannot disconnect herself from the network to avoid being disabled.</li>\n<li>Short lifespan: near her own route, she has only one year to live(it’s Mahoro!)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Exception\">Exception</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: it comes from the movie <em>Inception</em>, maybe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tired and bored after a day’s work, we may want to escape the real world, and embrace a virtual one. So one may imagine a switch mechanism for it: switch on, and we’re in the realm of imagination, and off, back to the real world.</p>\n<p>But such a kind of mechanism overlooks the interplay of this two worlds. Usually one playing a game is aware of its virtual nature, and is not separated from the outside. Take <em>Ready Player One</em> for example, control of the character in game is also affected by the lost of balance in the real world. So the virtual world can be greatly influenced by the real world, but it is often not the same the way around.</p>\n<p>With this asymmetry taken into consideration, a layered structure seems better to express this kind of relationship. Here we adopt the idea of a stack. The virtual domain is on the top, while the reality is in the bottom. The virtual world dominates our feelings when present, but we fall back to earth upon exiting the imaginary.</p>\n<p>So the reality-virtuality dichotomy can be expressed by a stack of size 2, let’s call it world stack from now. The real world is the first element of the world stack, and also the only element if we’re in reality. But if we dive into the virtual world, like OASIS, then we push the game onto the stack, and there’s two elements: the virtual world on top of the real world.</p>\n<p>And it is easy to extend the world stack to allow more than 2 elements.</p>\n<p>In a chapter of Douglas Hofstadter’s book <em>Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</em>, Achilles and the tortoise travels in and out Escher’s works by drinking blue and red phials. The travelling is done in a similar manner: going deeper into prints is like the push an item onto the stack, while going out out of the piece of artwork is like popping elements of the stack. And the world we are directly feeling is the top element of the stack.</p>\n<p>Though it bears resemblance to the stack data structure, the world stack has a definitive difference: we do not know how many elements are in the stack at any time. So here’s the problem: how can we know if the top element of the world stack is the real world? In other words, how can we tell if the world we’re right in real or not?</p>\n<p>We can check this by popping out elements, if there’s nothing to pop, then the world stack is empty, and the last world we popped is the real one. But note that popping out real world usually means one’s death. One never knows if the red pill is authentic before he washes it down. So we do not know if the current world we’re living is real, the only thing we know is since the real world is at the bottom, if we find out the current world is virtual, we can always pop out of it without getting ourselves killed.</p>\n<p>But the safety to pop out does not mean it is doable. For example, it is claimed that people in heaven never dies. So people are not able to access the world beyond heaven, just like the girls cannot come out of the screen.</p>\n<p>To solve this problem, <em>Apeiria</em> introduces a world structure similar to the stack model, but is different in its essence. In the game, the top and the bottom of the stack are connected, therefore the way in becomes the way out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Verdict\">Verdict</h2>\n<p><em>Apeiria</em> is a interesting combination of popular topics – AI, virtual reality – on the good old basis of Sci-Fi and fantasy. Unlike in <em>Sword Art Online</em>, where one is constant aware the world’s nature, <em>Apeiria</em> weaves a story across the borderline of reality and fantasy, which makes it capturing and different.</p>\n","site":{"data":{"config_en":{"title":"Goddess Unknown","subtitle":null,"description":"Peek into the abyss, to find the way towards light.","author":"NoirGif","feed":{"type":"rss2","path":"rss.xml","limit":20}},"config_zh-cn":{"feed":{"type":"rss2","path":"rss.xml","limit":20}}}},"thumbnailImageUrl":null,"excerpt":"","more":"<p>The title comes from <em>Sunless Sea</em>, an adventure game where the player explore the dark sea of unknown.

This strategy makes the post a little out of focus, and here’s another reason for it: the game is in a sense mediocre, because it does not exceeds one’s expectation.</p>\n<p>I don’t mean the game is bad. On the contrary, <em>Apeiria</em> is a good combination of popular concepts and has a capturing story. After all, if the game is really not good enough, I wouldn’t even bother to post an article about it, let alone go through iterations in this six months. The point is, however great the game is, <em>Apeiria</em> is just a galgame, nothing more, nothing less.</p>\n<p>It is hard to define what makes an art piece unique, but for a game, drawing moustache on character’s face and claiming the originality would be unique for the blatant copyright infringement. For a game, it could have great arts and music, humanly characters, a catching plot, or a thought-provoking theme. Kikiyama’s free game <em>Yume Nikki(Dream Diary)</em>, for example, features exploring exotic scenes with an unrealistic art style, whereas <em>The Last of Us</em>, an action game by Naughty Dogs, portrays humanity in a postapocalyptic world. And that’s one of the reasons why they receive acclaims from the fans.</p>\n<p>That being said, people’s mileages can greatly vary, and there’s no universal standard for good or bad games. So this post is not about judging whether a game is good or not, but just a peek into the core of the game.</p>\n<h2 id=\"No-Sense-Online\">No Sense Online</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: it comes from <em>Only Sense Online</em>, an online lightnovel by Aroha Zachou(literally Chairman Aloha) later published in print. AFAIK this lightnovel does not feature OreTueee.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The story of <em>Apeiria</em> happens in 2035, and people profit from the highly developed VR technology and AI research. Reiichi Kirishima, works together with his friends to build the VRMMORPG <em>Second</em>. The second is a fantasy world of sword and magic. One may suspect fantasy makes up most of the game, just as Reki Kawahara’s lightnovel <em>Sword Art Online</em>, and most online novels do. However, the story puts emphasis on both the real world and the virtual one. But the best part is, the two seemingly contradicting themes are tactfully merged in the end of the game.</p>\n<p>Back to the fantasy world. Usually to make a party, we need members of these sorts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Short- and/or mid-range attackers. They are usually deployed to defend the party members behind. Examples are thieves, swordsmans, lancers, and fighters. There should better be a tank to take the damage.</li>\n<li>Long-range attackers or scouts. They can discover enemies early, leaving enough time for preparation. Their attacks won’t be countered by short-range enemies. Archers, for example, belong to this category.</li>\n<li>Mages. If physical attack and magical attack are largely different in ways of effects and costs, then mages are needed to ensure a more comprehensive scope of attack.</li>\n<li>Healers or supporters. Their importance is never overemphasized.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Take Falcom’s <em>Legend of Heroes: Trails of the Cold Steel I</em> as a motivating example, we have:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Short-/mid-range: Rean(tachi), Laura(double-handed sword), Fie(dagger/gun), Jusis(knight sword), Gaius(spear)</li>\n<li>Long-range: Alisa(bow), Machias(shotgun), Eliot(staff), Emma(staff)</li>\n<li>Mages: Emma, Eliot</li>\n<li>Healer: Eliot, Emma</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this game everyone is able to use arts(what magic is called in this game), therefore the main difference between mages and others is that mages have higher magic attack/defence stats. So Eliot and Emma are not required as mages(though they are required as healers).</p>\n<p>Trails of the Cold Steel allows only four characters in the battle, with two substitute members, there are at most 6 members in the party most of the time. Let’s see how Falcom arranges the party in each chapter to make sure it is balanced:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rean(S), Alisa(L), Eliot(H), Laura(S)</li>\n<li>Rean(S), Emma(H), Fie(S), Machias(L), Jusis(S)</li>\n<li>Rean(S), Gaius(S), Jusis(S), Alisa(L), Emma(H)</li>\n<li>Rean(S), Laura(S), Fie(S), Machias(L), Eliot(H)</li>\n<li>Rean(S), Laura(S), Jusis(S), Emma(H), Millium(S)</li>\n<li>Rean(S), Alisa(L), Eliot(S), Machias(L), Fie(S), Crow(S)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Though there’s another system restricting the selection of members: there are four types of normal attack damage: slash, pierce, thrust, strike. Normal attacks from different characters have varied affinities to these types. For instance, Rean’s tachi attack has a high slash affinity, while Laura’s affinity to both slash and strike is high. And different enemies can be easily unbalanced by different types of attack damages. So the damage throughput could be increased by  using the right person to attack the enemies, leading to more unbalancing and link attacks. Though the system is marginal since the bosses can hardly be unbalanced(they don’t have this kind of weak point), the affinities of the characters are carefully arranged to make sure all four types are covered in the above party setups.</p>\n<p>However, in Apeiria, we see an unprecedented bias of party member roles. The constitution of the party is like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reiichi: short/mid-range attacker, main damage output, can revive himself and buff teammates</li>\n<li>Miu: sniper and healer. So roughly speaking, she’s Ana from <em>Overwatch</em>, while being a tsundere younger sister.</li>\n<li>Kuon: swordswoman, tank(she have a spell to call out an inpenetrable shield)</li>\n<li>Mashiro: thief, able to exchange money for rare items</li>\n<li>Apeiria: mage, persumably a DPS(second to Reiichi), unavailable most of the times.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As we can see Reiichi is ridiculously overpowered – he himself is a whole team. I guess it is probably due to the story. If my memory serves me right, the party is like the following in different times:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reiichi, Miu, Kuon, Mashiro, Apeiria</li>\n<li>Reiichi, Miu</li>\n<li>Reiichi, Kuon</li>\n<li>Reiichi, Mashiro</li>\n<li>Reiichi, Miu, Kuon, Mashiro</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Nanami and whatever are taking up much less a role, so they aren’t counted. Discussion about them can be left to the post about the game’s spinoff <em>Casablanca no Kishi(Knights of Casablanca)</em>, if there is one.</p>\n<p>Given this plot requirement, the usual party makeup does not make any sense, because Reiichi will have no chance of survival, turning the <em>Second</em> into souls-like games, and <em>Apeiria</em> into <em>Re:zero</em>. Powering up the heroines could be a good idea, but that will render the last fight, a one-on-one fight with the last boss unimpressive.</p>\n<p>This kind of unbalanced protagonist is mushrooming in lightnovels these years. With the uprise of coarse grained net novels, the use of such template is hitting new high. Let’s yell out some of the catch phrases:</p>\n<p><em>Shuujinkou saikyou</em>(protagonist the mightiest)!</p>\n<p><em>Ore tueeee</em>(I’m so stroooong)!</p>\n<p>Such settings bring about some benefits. One of them is that the story can always be kept under control. There’s no need for ex machina, because the overpowered protagonist themself is the ex machina. Another is that a group of readers are usually happy about it. Admittedly I was one of them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Apeiria-of-Love-and-Desire\">Apeiria of Love and Desire</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: it comes from <em>Aiyoku no Eustia</em>. <em>Ai</em> means tarnish rather than love, while <em>yoku</em> means wings instead of desire.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In August’s visual novel <em>Aiyoku no Eustia</em>, we have multiple routes, from Ellis the pharmacist to Eustia, the main heroine in the story.
