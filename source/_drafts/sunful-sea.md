The title comes from *Sunless Sea*, an adventure game where the player explore the dark sea of unknown. However, it has nothing to do with that game.

I suddenly wake up from the dream.

What comes into sight is the ceiling, and a blazing ray of light. The alarm is always good at catching me off guard.

I cannot recall it exactly, but it is in the Second, the world the five of us created together. After defeating Mother Dragon, the five of us continue our journey up Yggdrasil. And it turns out just a beginning: countless monsters reside in this central tower, and 100 is only half of its floors.

But when I come back to the reality, there is nothing but loneliness.

Even though I tried again and again, I still cannot save Apeiria from this game of death. I have reached the farthest this time: Apeiria ist heir, but with a time limit -- a year. Now the last second is drawing near: hours later I will have to send her back into the crucible of Second.

I have nothing more to lose now.

Miu, my step sister, has been disposed of because she did not meet her mother's expectation, who is ever pursuing the shadows of her aborted child.

Mashiro, the loyal member of the AI club, died from exposure to radiation due to the appliance malfunction in the First's open beta event.

Kuon, my childhood friend, is OK. But her mother, Towako, died in hospital with her unborn baby. Before the death, Kuon had a quarrel with Towako, and now she's lost the chance to reconcile forever.
