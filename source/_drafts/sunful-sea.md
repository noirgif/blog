The title comes from *Sunless Sea*, an adventure game where the player explore the dark sea of unknown.

## Background

With the boosting machine learning(no pun intended), the ideal of making a strong AI seems less infeasible. Also VR is gaining momentum so much that I'm like talking rubbish now. Since everything about them seems anew and promising, at least to the public, Silky's Plus Dolce decided to play with these ideas.

In the form of a galgame. Or say eroge.

## Plot

On Dec 24, 2045, an AI with superintelligence is borned, thanks to a chain of coincidences. Its name is Apeiria. It manages to usurp the control of 71 billion computers, name it Apeiria Network. With that superpower in hand, Reiichi -- the creator of Apeiria -- and his friends set out to create an immersive VRMMO called "Second".

If they are indulged in this world of sword and magic all the time till the end of the game, then you wouldn't be reading this post now.
