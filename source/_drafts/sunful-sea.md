The title comes from *Sunless Sea*, an adventure game where the player explore the dark sea of unknown. However, it has nothing to do with that game.

## Epilogue

It was unreal, but it felt real.

We are facing a giant dragon -- given that all dragons are large -- to fight our ways up the tower.

The tower of Yggdrasil is still looking down upon the world from the center today.  Modeled after the boundary tower in Amakusa, Tokyo, which is birthplace of the predecessor of this game, Yggdrasil is a lofty tower, too.

*A needle piercing into the space.*

 A crystal one, though, to fit in the overall fantasy art style of the Second. And like the boundary tower, Yggdrasil boasts a whole lot of floors -- 1000 of them, to be exact -- crammed with all kinds of monsters and challenges.

And we are the first one to set our feet on the tenth floor. It is almost cliche to put some strong monster in the floors of ten's multiples, and the AI is clearly sticking to this common practice when creating the Second.

One dragon was already beat when we first enter this tower, that is, the mother dragon. It was quite a tough one: it even nearly managed to suffocate us by burning out all the oxygen with its breath. But now, after countless battles, our team is invincible, and the dragon doesn't stand a chance.

Whoosh! its sweeps the ground with its left claw, but in vain. It took too much damage to maintain its swift actions. Time to deliver the last strike. I called out to my little sister.

"Miu! Covering fire!" "Gotcha!"

The dragon roared in pain as the bullet penetrates the dragon's eyes. The monster raises its head, it want to cast a breath.

"Kuon!" "Needless to say!"

Kuon cast the spell, which forms a shield protected all of us from the devastating breath. I looked to Apeiria, and she knows what I'm gonna do in an glimpse.

"You are powered up, owner, get in there!"

I run forward towards to dragon, to deliver the final blow.

"Mashiro, come back!" "Roger!" The little silouette who's attacking with combos jumps back, agile like a humming bird.

A few steps forth, I get face to face with the hideous monster. Time for my ultimate sword.

"1/8!"

Eight beams spreads out in an instant, all of them punching the dragon, lighting the last moment of this floor master.

With a death agony, the large figure collapsed to the ground and dispersed.

After I confirmed the death of the dragon, other party members come to me.

"Miu, good shot."

"Of course. Who you think I am?"

And I turned to my childhood friend.

"Kuon, your spells are of great help, too." "Reiichi, it is okay to depend more on your older sister, you get it?"

"Well done, Mashiro." "Eeh?! Th-th-thank you!" The introverted junior is still shy about compliments today.

"Apeiria." I hugged the girl with silver hair. "You are the best."

"Owner, plus, hug, equals, happiness." The girl in my embrace replied with her monotonic voice, but with a tinge of delight.

"Hentai..." Complaints comes from the little sister with a cold-eyed gaze.

"..."

"Owner?"

"..."

It feels real, but it is unreal.

My eyes are open now. It's not inside the magnificent crystal tower. Not but my monochromatic bedroom.

The window is wide open. A gust of December's chilly wind breaks in, across my face and between my fingers.

"It's ... cold." The wind must receive a summons for trespassing.

Today Apeiria will set off to Second, which has been already a hell. No one could return from that world of death. But there are no other options: she should have gone there a year ago, and this probation is as much as I could get.

The digital clock says it's 7. I step into my slippers and out of my bedroom.

There is already one up.

"Good morning, owner." The silver-haired girl notices me.

"Morning, Apeiria." I try to make myself sound more energetic.

The dried-up response echoes in the empty house. There is nobody besides the two of us.

Miu isn't here. She isn't in this world any more.

She was disposed by her mother. Miu was created as a clone of that woman, who has been haunted by the shadows of her aborted child.

I walk to the kitchen, Apeiria is preparing the breakfast.

"A few minutes and it will be done, owner."

The breakfast time in Kirishima's is filled with silence. The clashing sounds of utensils reverbrate in the room.

After I'm done with the meal, I speak to Apeiria.

"It's the last day, isn't it?" 

"Affirmative, owner."

"Then let's hang out."

We first arrives at the AI circle in the school. Full name "Lovable AI Circle", the circle has had two members -- I, the founder, and Mashiro, who I forcibly dragged in. After I created Apeiria here, the five of us have had a lot memories here -- making the VR MMORPG Second, and playing it together as a team. But Mashiro is not here.

She is dead from radiation in Boundary's beta test, when the machine suddenly malfunctioned.

A double-slit box sits on the table. When I turn it on, it's still showing interference pattern.

The DNA computer is turned off now. Apeiria is accidentally created from it when a lightning cut off its power about a year ago. And I managed to get her a body by hacking the genetic research facility.

There is nothing to do here. After the door is shutted with a huge noise, and silence dominates the school again.

Next stop is the boundary tower. Usually it was once full of people, especially when Boundary was in tests. After that accident, people are showing concerns about safety issues of the VR games, and the development of Boundary is put to a halt.

"Owner, will we be seeing Kuon?"

"Forget about it."

Kuon's father is the creator of the Boundary, so the family lives on the top floor of the boundary tower. One year ago, She had a quarrel with her mother, who fell unconscious soon afterwards and died days later. And Kuon never had a chance to apologize. Since then, I haven't got in contact with her as much.

After having lunch in Asakusa, we decide to return.

Bang, and the door closed. It's the familiar living room today.

The digit clock in the phone says it's already 2pm. So the separation is only a few hours away.

In this year, we've been to everywhere we are able to go, done everything we are able to do. I promised to teach her what is love, but things are not going as expected.

Sometimes I doubt if I've made the right choice: is it fine to hold her back here, who is not supposed to be born and hated by the world, for a year? Is it right to spend so much time together, only to make the parting more heartbreaking?

And who is Thinker after all? Is he the observer who's been peeking into this world? Why does the observer want to do with Apeiria?

I take out my phone from the pocket. In it there are the mails sent by my future self.

"There are two Thinkers."

"The observer is human."

And things like that. I pondered about these things again and again, but to no avail. This time I try again to find out what it means.

The observer ... is human ...

Wait.

The viruses, the time loop, the disappearing interference pattern.

*The observer is human.*

The appearing viruses in the house just confirm my thought.

*It feels real, but it is unreal.*

"Apeiria! Run!" I grab her hand and run for the door.

"Affirmative. What's the heading, owner, by the way, why are viruses here?" She replies with a mite of bewilderment.

The answer to the first is clear. *The way out is the way in.*

Since we cannot rely on Apeiria network and the nanobots now, there is only one way into the Second.

"The boundary tower!"

## Title

The title of *Hikari no Umi no Apeiria* is deceptive -- actually no seas exist in the game, so the ones who expect beach, sunlight and bikinis might find themselves deeply disappointed. Apeiria is the name which the protagonist Reiichi gives to the AI he developed, maybe because he thinks some Greek sounds cool.

## Features

### Some on-the-edge stuff

When the world is overwhelmed with things like deep learning, AI, and virtual reality, someone found it a good idea to put these new concepts together, not to create something new, but to revisit something vintage but popular elements present in the old Sci-Fi novels. As a result, *Hikari no Umi no Apeiria* is out.

As one may suspect, Hikari no Umi no Apeiria has got all of these topics covered.

Usually, creators, while using an idea to their own avail, make almost no notes on how it works. What's worse, some concepts are ditched as soon as they are introduced, like they are disposable. So in this way, they are only used as an eye-catcher, and in its core, the story is nothing different from others.

And I'm afraid it's the case with Apeiria. As I have or haven't said before, Apeiria system is the AI developed by Reiichi. System means she is not a person *yet*. And in the beginning, before he sets out to the park for that fateful encounter with Miu, he mentions the Apeiria system is so weak that he needs to train it(originally "let it go through some deep learning"). Some people might think the game will go over something about neural networks and training. But life is full of surprise: he does not train Apeiria henceforth, in reality he just plugs Apeiria system into his old DNA computer, along with his own DNA, and guess what: suddenly a thunder strikes, and the power is cut. By the time the electricity restores, Abracadabra: Apeiria is born, out of nowhere. There is no training at all, only magic. 

But to be exact, it is neither magic nor coincidence that gives birth to Apeiria. However, the reasons are deeply connected with the mechanism of the world, which is not even known to Reiichi himself by then, and not uncovered until the last minute of playing. By which I mean it is a huge spoiler so I'll keep it to myself.

### Template

If I'd describe the plot like a narou novel, it might be something like:

{% quote %}

I'm Reiichi Kirishima, an ordinary high schooler, and chairman of the Moeru AI Club. My friends and I were enjoying the VR MMORPG game Second which we created, but suddenly we found ourselves stuck in this fantasy world! And guess, force logout means biological death! I, with my cheating skills, am going to save Apeiria who has been abducted, and the players trapped in this world, by the way!

{% endquote %}

If it is for real, nothing other than those mass-produced template online lightnovels, I wouldn't gone into length with this post. To be honest, it would not even exist. I'm not denouncing those novels, since they are themselves for no bad reasons. But they are just not interesting enough to write something about.

### Eros

When I talk about a galgame, I'm usually talking about an adult one, because almost all of them feature some adult content. *Sakura no Uta*, for example, is one of them. However, as in [that post](/17/05/09/sakuranouta), I make little to no references about the adult content. There are some reasons. First, it is only a minor part of the game, if it is not the game's main focus(those emphasizing the adult content are also called eroge, which stands for erotic game). What's more, it has almost no impact on the plot, so it doesn't hurt to omit them.

However, one who plays *Hikari no Umi no Apeiria* may be surprised how integral eroticism is to this game, almost to the extent of Rance series. Reiichi's first encouter with his step sister Miu is marked by the ejacuation into her face: Reiichi tries to see how far he could come in the park, and the poor Miu just happened to be in his way when he comes.

To add to the chaos, in the game of Second, Reiichi's ability(called desire in the game) is deeply related to his desire for sex, and his quick and violent cum. And he names his avatar *Zekken* in the game out of proud about it. He can shoot out multiple beams from his clotch, protect himself from a deadly hit for once, and enhance others' desire by having sex with them. Thanks to this desire, Reiichi manages to get his hands on the hips of all his teammates(Kuon, Mashiro, and Miu, they are to rescue Apeiria from Thinker), plus another two.

But obscene jokes are only part of it.

### Theories

Theories serve two purposes: to predict, or to explain. In *Apeiria*, several theories are proposed to explain the inexplicable phenomena throughout the game. As a result, a huge portion of the game is devoted to causing players' headache.



## Notes

* *Hikari no Umi no Apeiria*: A galgame made by Silky's Plus Dolce. It won the third place in the all-round department of Moe Game Awards 2017, a galgame contest. The title is written as *Kei no Umi no Apeiria*. Kei means the landscape, whereas umi is the Japanese word for the sea. However, by putting hikari on top of the kei, now the Kanji is read as such, which means the light. Hence comes the light-ful sea in the title.

* Galgame: It could refer to no only as board as all games featuring cute girls, but as narrow as date simulations with them. Gal is the mispronunciation of girl.

* Affirmative: Apeiria uses the word positive as a yes.

* Apeiria: It comes from the Greek word *apeiron*, which means without limit. No tense of apeiron is apeiria.

* Virtual Reality: The one and only place where otakus can make a girlfriend.

* Deep learning: A branch of machine learning involving deep structures for modeling. Usually it refers to neural networks with a lot of layers, but random forests and whatever can also be taken into account.

* AI: All-encompassing Industry. It's an industry permeating every aspect of life, at least that's what is said to the investors and the public.

* Narou: An online lightnovel platform. Everybody is free to post their articles there, recent years it is plagued with high and low fantasies with an overpowered protagonist(called cheating). [link(Japanese)](narou.syosetu.com)

* Lightnovel: A kind of novels focusing on pattern reuse.

* Fantasy: A perfect excuse for any plot twists. Also, a theme where half the text could be used to explain stuff like magic, culture, everything.

* Force logout leading to death: Probably started by Sword Art Online, a popular series of lightnovels authored by Reki Kawahara.

* Trapped in fantasy world: A trick to keep the story inside the fantasy, and away from real world matters which are so complex that they would blow up the brains of the poor lightnovel writers if present.

* Cheating: A technique, commonly seen in online novels, to force the plot to progress without getting into trouble.

* In the game world one's created or played: usually it means the protagonist has more knowledge than others in the world, which is another kind of cheating(usually they come in the forms of OP stats, special skills or quick growth). *Nekomimineko* falls in this pattern, the protagonist harnesses the bugs in the game at will.

* Abducted heroine: it's the recurrent theme of Mario and Zelda, but the same thing does not apply for others.

* Reiichi: Rei means zero, and ichi means one in Japanese. It adds some binary flavor to the game.
