We are setting out today.

Ack, maybe I've ruined it already, but we're going out now. Farewell to the village where we were born.

Is it OK to be alone with a girl? No idea. Maybe so. You know, there are few parties of brave being incapacitated by loving affairs before even greeting the last boss. History teaches us that something hard to screw up is always hard to screw up.

See? Even Rance has managed it. Many times. That's thanks to the power of being an H-game protagonist? Then I think it's fine for me. I don't have this power, after all.

I turned to her, who's walking on my left, "Lola, you think we'll end up in an item?"

"Why? Did you hit your head somewhere and get short-circuited? You may need some repair, but that's not until we reach the next town, what a pity, for my having to stand your stupidity from the beginning of the journey." 

"Uh?... Is this the case? ... Think I should do a sanity check now."

"No help. Like HIV, it doesn't manifest itself before a wait for 3-4 weeks. So you may expect it's never too easy for these peccadilloes to go undetected."

"Even it's possible, why do a sanity check when you're not sane? A lunatic will never claims their lunacy. When you're not sure about yourself anymore, you're ready to bring in a logical paradox, which will wipe out your existence from this world. For good. So stop it and let's hurry on. We're doomed if we are getting too slack."

"I think you're right, forget it." I feel a strong sense of disconcert. Something born with me was just smashed and tossed into the trashcan. What's worse, I don't know what that thing is. She's right, I'd better stop thinking too much about it.

"What's the heading?" Wish my memory is still functioning.

"Oh that. It's NENEENNENNENEEEEENENEEENEENEEEE..."

"'The hell is that?" Looks like she will do it forever, so I decided to have a manual override.

"You don't even know that? Just like NEN is 22.5 degrees from north to east, all directions can be expressed in a way that is the directional angle divided by 360 degrees, in binary. It is widely preferred over the old metrics. It's more flexible, because $$ \log 2 = 0.30 $$ You can choose between 0 and 3 digits with binary, but with decimals, only 0 or 1. Also it's much easier for one to divide an angle into two equal ones than ten of them, right? Let alone the awful radians. You can't construct an one-radian angle even with the help of a ruler and a compass. A 2.718 radians one will surely blows up your mind."

"By the way, this compass is pretty good. It reads 50 binary digits off the decimal point. However, a random direction would almost certainly be irrational, so there are actually innumerable digits."

"We've been following down this NENNENNE path for a couple of minutes. After a while we'll make a turn and go NENEEENE."

"Once we arrive at Road NEN and Highway NE, things will be much simpler." She thrusts the map back into the bag. My bag. She's only carrying a purse with her dear staff. Her personal things are all in that purse. Really impressive. She's like a prestidigitator when pulling out her Ju^nihitoe, just to use it to suffocate me with its weight. I don't know how much it weighs. 20 kilos, I guess.

She abruptly looks back, a little irked. "You're not thinking something strange, are you?"

"Nah." I replied in an instant.
