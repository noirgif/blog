The title refers to the galgame series made by previously KID, and an eighth installment of it is near publication by MAGES, the brand's now owner, collaborated with Hikari Field. The title was once decided to be a homage to one of the songs of Jin's Kagerou Project, but you are not seeing it here because I didn't remember it until halfway.

One can never overemphasize the import of memories. Without them, we would be brushing our teeth repeatedly until death. Those who don't brush their teeth in the morning will be a little more fortunate -- they will die from eating too much breakfast.

In addition, the overall development of humanity will be hampered, given the fact that we learn by memorizing. Imagine a physicist has to go over the basic of physics every day, just like eating breakfast, never could they reach anywhere beyond what a person can go through in one day. Even if we do not need the most elemental to progress, it still bears some liking to the game of Tiny Wings: the bird flaps its wings trying to fly as far as it can, only to be caught up by the darkness in the end.

But that's not what I'm driving at, since the it is not interesting enough to erase all people's memory periodically, what is interesting is to manipulate a person's, as is present in abundance in today's works. It is one of the most easy ways to set up suspense by removing the past from the protagonist. It is safe to assume almost all memory loss twists serve this specific purpose, but the ways to do it can vary -- getting hit by a car, magic, such and such.

A mobile game I've mentioned in a previous post -- *waiting for you 7 years later*, or whatever it translates to -- features the very plot. The protagonist, losing his memories of a childhood friend but only the appointment with her, returned to his hometown after seven years as promised, and there by going through time loops, he comes to know what really happened seven years ago, and decides to go back to save her. The loss of memory, as it turns out in the end, is the reason behind all these ruckuses. And to add to it, the removal of it was intended for everything to happen seven years later. So the loss of memory could be used not only for suspenses but also as an integral part of the story.

And the same mechanism is also utilized by Mori Juumoji to near the extent of plagiarism in their lightnovel *Libryrinth*(I just made it up, the name of the book is *Tosho Meikyuu*, namely "the maze of book"). The maze of books is, as its name suggests, a maze full of magic books located under the city of Alexandria. Soushi Okutsuki, in the incident five years ago, witnessed the murder of his father there, and he lost his memory and ability to use magic. After spending 5 years in Japan, he returns to the spot trying to find out what happened on that day. However, when he suddenly wakes up from a bad dream wherein he gets killed, he finds himself in the dormitory of Apothecaria, an academy in Alexandria. And soon he realizes what he thought to be a dream is true, and he is still alive because he's become a vampire, the most loathed of all species. To make things worse, as a side effect of becoming a vampire, he can only maintain 8 hours of memory, plus the capacity of a 1000-page book "Saigo no Inori" (the last prayer). To find out the truth as before, and the book which cures amnesia, Soushi sets out again to the labyrinth.
