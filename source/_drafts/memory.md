The title refers to the galgame series made by previously KID, and an eighth installment of it is near publication by MAGES, the brand's now owner, collaborated with Hikari Field. The title was once decided to be a homage to one of the songs of Jin's Kagerou Project, but you are not seeing it here because I didn't remember it until halfway.

One can never overemphasize the import of memories. Without them, we would be brushing our teeth repeatedly until death. Those who don't brush their teeth in the morning will be a little more fortunate -- they will die from eating too much breakfast.

In addition, the overall development of humanity will be hampered, given the fact that we learn by memorizing. Imagine a physicist has to go over the basic of physics every day, just like eating breakfast, never could they reach anywhere beyond what a person can go through in one day. Even if we do not need the most elemental to progress, it still bears some liking to the game of Tiny Wings: the bird flaps its wings trying to fly as far as it can, only to be caught up by the darkness in the end.

But that's not what I'm driving at, since the it is not interesting enough to erase all people's memory periodically, what is interesting is to manipulate a person's, as is present in abundance in today's works. It is one of the most easy ways to set up suspense by removing the past from the protagonist. It is safe to assume almost all memory loss twists serve this specific purpose, but the ways to do it can vary -- getting hit by a car, magic, such and such.

A mobile game I've mentioned in a previous post -- *waiting for you 7 years later*, or whatever it translates to -- features the very plot. The protagonist, losing his memories of a childhood friend but only the appointment with her, returned to his hometown after seven years as promised, and there by going through time loops, he comes to know what really happened seven years ago, and decides to go back to save her. The loss of memory, as it turns out in the end, is the reason behind all these ruckuses. And to add to it, the removal of it was intended for everything to happen seven years later. So the loss of memory could be used not only for suspenses but also as an integral part of the story.

And the same mechanic is present in Mori Juumoji's lightnovel *Libryrinth*(I just made it up, the name of the book is *Tosho Meikyuu*, namely "the maze of book"). Soushi Okutsuki, in the incident five years ago, witness the decease of his father, also lost were with his memory and magic ability. Five years later, he returns to the city of Alexandria, and down to the maze of books, to find out what happened on that special day. However, when he suddenly wakes up, he finds himself unable to remember anything happened yesterday, and also, he has died once and become a vampire. Sleeping near him is Alteria, "the high daylight walker".
