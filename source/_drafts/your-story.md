## First glance

*Kimi no Hanashi (君の話)* is a novel written by Sugaru Miaki, published by Hayakawa Shobo in July 2018. Since it's a tankoubon, it's more expensive than bunkobon, which is smaller in size, and do not have a hard cover. The price range for TKB is from 1000 yen to 2000, while it usually takes half the price to buy a BKB. Usually BKB is targeting a wide audience, rather than a small bunch of people. As a result, a book that may not have a lot of readers usually is published in TKB, and lightnovels are often available in BKB only. I'm reading the electronic version, so it makes no real difference to me, though. Great pity.

It's not categorized as a lightnovel, but literature in Bookwalker, an online e-book store. But the line is vague here. Lightnovels published in TKB, say, *Death March* and *Youjo Senki*, are also put in the category. However, one can tell by first sight the book is not an ordinary lightnovel, even if it is one.

A beautiful -- but not moe -- girl, in a pure white dress, holding a bunch of blue flower, is on the cover. Far from the lively and kawaii ones shared by most lightnovels, it's a feel of beauty and stasis. The falling petals from the bunch of flowers and the sky-blue background further adds a tinge of sadness to the whole picture.

By the way, the attribute of the illustration goes to [Mayumi Konno](https://www.mayumikonno.com/). She (I assume she is a she) uses acrylic to paint, so her works give out a unique atmosphere. The previous works of Miaki published by Mediaworks Bunko also have gorgeous covers, but they are not of the same kind as this one.

And about Sugaru Miaki, I didn't know much about him. I have read a novel authored by him named *Itai no Itai no Tondeyuke*, which is a very moving and tragedic story, and that's it. I have no idea what he has written on 2ch as Genfuukei . To make things worse, I didn't realize the two works come from the same person.

The abstract further uncovers the story:

{% quote %}

Somehow by mistake, the lonely young man Chihiro Amaya is planted false memories about his youth. And in that summer, he come across Touka Natsunagi, the childhood friend who shouldn't exist. Touka says to the confused Chihiro, "you ... forgot a lot." A love story that continues before the encounter, and ends before it starts.

{% endquote %}

The word end (終わる in Japanese) is telling something. Or should I say, the name of Sugaru Miaki is already telling it, but it is neglected by me out of my ignorance.

## Background

Just like artificial limbs help people footing or grabbing, artificial teeth help people chew, artificial memories help to fill the blank in the heart. With *Honeymoon*, one can maintain a sweet memory with his/her spouse, *Angel* satisfies those who craves for a child, and *Green Green* is for those who want to recolor their grey teenage life. But the word artificial memory just describe the half of the matter: you can not only implant memories, but you can remove them as well, no matter it's artificial or not. If one has a depressing breakup, a trauma, or just something they want to forget, then a cup of *Lethe* is enough to wipe them off head.

Chihiro Amaya, 

## In the end: about this article, and future ones

Every time I decide to write something about something, a game for example, the idea is always as simple as "this game is very interesting, so I'd like more people to know it". But I find it hard, again and again, to convert the fractured ideas into one word and another, and to put them together to compose an article. How to pick up the points that interest me most? How to convey them without spoiling the whole story? How to make them looking as good as they really are? And they keep worrying me throughout the whole process.

Often a problem bothers me is what to write about the game, or novel. I tried retracing my spiritual journey with DDLC, so I ended up spoiling almost everything about it, including the most surprising (scary) part. And worse, it's more like a self-entertaining diary than a real recommendation, even though all of the posts here are results of my self-entertainment. After that, I went very conservative about Apeiria, and also Iris. So at a glance there's a change of mind, but those are unintended, and there are different reasons behind them. For Apeiria, the pastiche of popular elements like hi-fantasy, time loop, etc. makes it a perfect starting point for a discursive talk. While in the Iris case, the plot is just too less magnificent compared with the SCPs it involved, making me feel kind of empty to spoil it too much (though I did it, I admit).

This time I will attempt to do it in the same way I did with DDLC, but in a more objective way. If I had time, I would make another post about another work I read months ago, a lightnovel I also mentioned in the "Memories, Off" post. 

For games like Summer Pockets and ISLAND, there are already too much babbling on the Internet. And a player would be convinced that they are great by just looking at their makers: Visual Arts Key and Frontwing, respectively. So it would end up writting a recommendation to people who already know its value, which isn't of much appeal to me. Therefore, no ping-pong or irangers planned.
