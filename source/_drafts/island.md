These things happens in Urashima, a distant island.

197x A.D.

    After about 20,000 years of cryogenic sleep, Linne Ohara woke and was found in Urashima. She lost almost all her memories including her name. She was then employed as a servant in Ohara residence.
    
    The nameless servant became friends with Natsumi Kurutsu and Maria Garando.
    
    The nameless servant was named Kuu.

    Avalon and the church reconciled.

    The explorers including Setsuna Ohara was sent by the church in search for Avalon, the purported paradise in the Bible(not the one of Christianity). Almost all of them died without finding the place.

    7 of them, including Setsuna, returned on whom the soot blight shows effect. The church decided to suppress the information about the disease, so they set fire to the hospital where they were accomodized. 6 of the ill died from fire.
