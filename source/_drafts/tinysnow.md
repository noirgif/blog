A month or two ago, [this game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1002560/Tiny_Snow/) gained its fame through an unexpected way. In reply to an review criticizing the depiction being bad of how lovey dovey the duo are, the developer said: that's because ... well ... I myself haven't had a girlfriend.

Personally I feel a little sad for him. Although I might not be entitled to do so, since I am still single myself (fortunately I'm not too bothered by it). And also for his game. From now on when people talks about *Tiny Snow*, it will always be "that game made by the poor beta male" rather than "a kawaii game, but tries to cover some serious topics", while the latter somehow better describe this game as a game.

## Plot

> If you are made into loving someone, what will you do?

The story starts with the protagonist, an assistant of the professor, how adopted him since he was young, running away to a shabby wooden house in a snowy mountain to focus on the research. However, little Rong[^1], his clingy sister, also an adopted child of the professor, followed him into this uninhabited place. The two of them both have a feeling for each other, and this feeling grows untampered as the two live together in this sequestered small hut.

However, the protagonist knows a secret, that he and his little sister are subjects of the professor's experiment. In this experiment, they are made into thinking the each other is the best fit. And that's what bugs the protagonist -- choosing to be with Rong means that he succumbs to manipulation.

But he has to make a choice.
