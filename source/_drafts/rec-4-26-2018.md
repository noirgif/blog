## Computing Method

### Jacobi iterative method

In the equation $Ax = b$,

let D = sum(A, 1), then
$$
(D+A-D)x = Ax = b\\
DX = (D-A)x+b
$$
So,
$$
X^{(k+1)} = D'(D-A)x^{(k)}+b
$$

Condition of convergence:

Row diagonal dominance:

Each diagonal element has an absolute value greater than the sum of the absolute values of other elements in the same row, namely

$$
\left|a_{jj}\right| \ge \sum_{i\neq j} \left|a_{ji}\right| \ for\ all\ j
$$

Swap $i$ and $j$ in the above $a_{ji}$, we've got the definition of column diagonal dominance.

If the above A is strictly diagonally dominant, then Jacobi method is convergent.

Proof:

The point is to prove each of $D^{-1}(D-A)$'s eigenvalues have absolute value less than 1.

Lemma 1(Levyâ€“Desplanques theorem): A strictly diagonally dominant matrix is non-singular. 

### Gauss-Seidel

Let $A=D+L+U$, where D is diagonal, L is lower-triangle, U is upper-triangle.

$$
AX=(D+L+U)X=(D+L)X+UX=b\\
(D+L)X=-UX+b\\
$$
Make it iterative:
$$
(D+L)X^{(k+1)}=-UX^{(k)}+b
$$
Then we have:
$$
X^{(k+1)}=-(D+L)^{-1}UX^{(k)}+(D+L)^{-1}b
$$

* Generally the same as Jacobi

* Jacobi is $x_2 = R * x_1 + g$, whereas Gauss-Seidel is $x_2 = R * x_2 + g$.

### Computer Architecture

#### Tomasulo Algorithm

##### Difference from scoreboard

* Use reservation stations as a way to store the operands and results of the instructions
  * Rename registers in the instructions with the name of the RS's -> avoid WAW and WAR hazard.
  * Since RS's are more than registers, it allows space for more aggressive optimization.
* Operands are passed to float units from reservation stations rather than registers, and the results of float-point operations are boardcasted using common data bus
* Load and save buffers are seen as reservation stations as well.

##### Three steps

1. Issue: If there's free reserve stations, issue the instruction with register renaming
2. Execution: If the operands are ready, execute the instruction
3. Write result: write results in RS's to corresponding places
