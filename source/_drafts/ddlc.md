Doki Doki Literature Club!(DDLC!) is a free game that has made to Steam around Oct. Despite being a visual novel, a genre which only a minority would enjoy because of the lack of playability, it's quite a hit among all kinds of players, scoring a 97% in its over 40k reviews(as of Dec 18, 2017), which is quite a feat, given it's from a large group of people, rather than a small bunch of loyal fans(which can be quite decisive, like *Megadimension Neptunia*, it is 98% positive, but only 1.6k players have reviewed the game).

So let's dig into it a little bit.

As a galgame(or it appears to be), DDLC! features four cute schoolgirls: Sayori, the outgoing childhood friend, and vice president of the club; Natsuki, a tiny figure who likes baking and watching manga; Yuri, a composed one who acts with maturity; and Monika, president of the club, who is lively and thoughtful. Your goal is to have a great festival with them, and finally, get one of the girl's heart. The story is set in a highschool, so all of the four girls are (probably) underaged, making XX impossible, maybe I can talk about it later how game makers are bypassing the age restriction, but let's focus on this game for now.

At least that's what everybody expected on seeing its download page. Though it says that the game is not for those who are easily disturbed, maybe it's just too disturbing in a *sexual* sense. You know, a common trait of these galgames. Even a [game dubbed R18](http://store.steampowered.com/app/416130/) can make its way to Steam(don't play it, since it's also an example of poorly written and executed VN). And for some others, while the game itself is PG on Steam, have a R18 patch distributed, for free(like those sakuragame published games) or with a price(Nekopara). So such somewhat horny elements('oiroke youso' in Japanese) is not that unacceptable, but rather, welcome.

But it turns out not to be the case for DDLC!. Quite the opposite. After Nekopara's **first person shooter** tag, someone might think it's another joke upon the first sight of the tags of DDLC!. However, this time there's no joke. DDLC!, as the tag **psychological horror** suggests, is actually a story full of scares, revealing a darker side of personality. The same tag for *Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy*, on the other hand, is only a funny reference of the game's extraordinary difficulty.

The game begins with the typical galgame plot, the MC(the player gives him a name), on his childhood friend Sayori's invitation, decides to pay the club she's in-the literature club-a visit. There he meets the other three girls. He's warmly welcomed: Natsuki makes cupcakes for everyone, and Yuri brings him a book to read. At last, president Monika, given the iminnent school festival, proposes that everyone writes a poem, and brings it the second day to share with each other.

And here comes the main mechanic. To make a poem, you need to choose 20 words, each one from a pool of 10 words. Each word appeals most to a specific girl, and the hint is given during the day: Yuri loves something abstract and metaphorical, while cute words like lollipop or pout are appealing to Natsuki. And about Sayori, she have an inclination towards human emotion, and is drawn to both words for happiness and ones for sadness, which is made clear in the second day. The girl's storyline will progress whose loved words are chosen the most. There are stickers of the girls showing in the poem writing part. When a word is chosen, the corresponding girl will jump, making an easy indicator.

The girls react differently to the poems. That is, if you write a poem that attract Sayori most, for Natsuki it will be just plain. And if you write a "Yuri" poem on the second day, after Natsuki and Yuri had a quarrel about writing style, Natsuki may even feel sorry for that she has insulted the style of both Yuri and the MC, and runs away. Of course, as a part of the sharing, you will read the poems written by the four girls, and they are mostly identical to their word preference.

The real nature of the game is hidden in this phase, but clues are revealed little by little. Monika's Writing Tips on the second day is a fourth-wall breaking one: save on important moments. On the third day, Sayori becomes a bit off, and she's written a poem, which is really creepy according to the MC: 
{% quote %}
They were supposed to be for my friends, my friends who aren't smiling.
They're all shouting, pleading. Something.
But all I hear is echo, echo, echo, echo, echo
Inside my head
{% endquote %}

The poem managed to take a toll on my sanity. And Yuri's poem today seems a mite uncanny as well. It tells a story of 'I' and a raccoon. 'I' feed the raccoon with bread crumbs every day, and as a result the raccoon grows excitement when 'I' show the very knife used for cutting. In the end of the poem:
{% quote %}
A rush of blood. Classic Pavlovian conditioning. I slice the bread.
And I feed myself again.
