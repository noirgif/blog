Doki Doki Literature Club!(DDLC) is a free game that has made to Steam around Oct. Despite being a visual novel, a genre which only a minority would enjoy because of the lack of playability, it's quite a hit among all kinds of players, scoring a 97% in its over 40k reviews(as of Dec 18, 2017), which is quite a feat, given it's from a large group of people, rather than a small bunch of loyal fans(which can be quite decisive, like *Megadimension Neptunia*, it is 98% positive, but only 1.6k players have reviewed the game).

So let's dig into it a little bit.

As a galgame(or it appears to be), DDLC features four cute schoolgirls: Sayori, the outgoing childhood friend, and vice president of the club; Natsuki, a tiny figure who likes baking and watching manga; Yuri, a composed one who acts with maturity; and Monika, president of the club, who is lively and thoughtful. Your goal is to have a great festival with them, and finally, get one of the girl's heart. The story is set in a highschool, so all of the four girls are (probably) underaged, making XX impossible, maybe I can talk about it later how game makers are bypassing the age restriction, but let's focus on this game for now.

At least that's what everybody expected on seeing its download page. Though it says that the game is not for those who are easily disturbed, maybe it's just too disturbing in a *sexual* sense. You know, a common trait of these galgames. Even a [game dubbed R18](http://store.steampowered.com/app/416130/) can make its way onto Steam(don't play it, since it's also an example of poorly written and executed VN), so one may assume it's not that heavily censored. And for some others, while the games themselves are PG, have R18 patches distributed, for free(like those sakuragame published games) or with a price(Nekopara). So such somewhat horny elements(*oiroke youso* in Japanese) is not that unacceptable, but rather, welcome.

But it turns out not to be the case for DDLC. Quite the opposite. After Nekopara's **first person shooter** tag, someone might think it's another joke upon the first sight of the tags of DDLC. However, this time there's no joke. DDLC, as the tag **psychological horror** suggests, is actually a story full of scares, revealing a darker side of personality. The same tag for *Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy*, on the other hand, is only a funny reference to the game's extraordinary difficulty.

The game begins with the typical galgame plot, the MC(the player gives him a name), on his childhood friend Sayori's invitation, decides to pay the club she's in-the literature club-a visit. There he meets the other three girls. He's warmly welcomed: Natsuki makes cupcakes for everyone, and Yuri brings him a book to read. At last, president Monika, given the iminnent school festival, proposes that everyone writes a poem, and brings it the second day to share with each other.

And here comes the game's main mechanism. To compose a poem, you need to gather 20 words, each of them is chosen from a pool of 10 words. Each word appeals most to a specific heroine, and the hint is given during the day: Yuri loves something abstract and metaphorical, while cute words like lollipop or kawaii are appealing to Natsuki. And about Sayori, she have an inclination towards human emotion, and is drawn to both words for happiness and ones for sadness, which is made clear in the second day. The girl's storyline will progress whose loved words are chosen the most. There are stickers of the girls showing on the left while making a poem. When a word is chosen, the corresponding girl will jump, making an easy indicator.

The girls react differently to the poems. That is, if you write a poem that attract Sayori most, for Natsuki it will be just plain. And if you write a "Yuri" poem on the second day, after Natsuki and Yuri had a quarrel about writing style, Natsuki may even feel sorry for that she has insulted the style of both Yuri and the MC, and runs away. Of course, as a part of the sharing, you will read the poems written by the four girls, and they are mostly identical to their word preference.

The real nature of the game is hidden in this phase, but clues are revealed little by little. Monika's Writing Tips on the second day is a fourth-wall breaking one: save on important moments. On the third day, Sayori becomes a bit off, and she's written a poem, which is really creepy according to the MC: 
{% blockquote Sayori, Bottle%}
They were supposed to be for my friends, my friends who aren't smiling.
They're all shouting, pleading. Something.
But all I hear is echo, echo, echo, echo, echo
Inside my head
{% endblockquote %}

The poem managed to take a toll on my sanity. And Yuri's poem today seems a mite uncanny as well. It tells a story of 'I' and a raccoon. 'I' feed the raccoon with bread crumbs every day, and as a result the raccoon grows excitement when 'I' show the very knife used for cutting. In the end of the poem:
{% blockquote Yuri, The Raccoon %}
A rush of blood. Classic Pavlovian conditioning. I slice the bread.
And I feed myself again.
{% endblockquote %}

But to my relief, Yuri seems to be normal after all, at least for now, you can even witness her cuteness if you choose to help her out on the fourth day. And she's like cuuuuuuuuteeeeeeee, the embarassment after her licking <del>your</del> MC's hurt finger is good. I don't really think that way. I'm just pretending to be innocent. Unconscious finger licking is just too archetypal for an anime girl, because it can show the girl's other side of loveliness, in spite of how elegant and composed she might usually be.

So I just root for Natsuki for the weekend event. In this case, <del>you</del> the MC does a *Kabedon* on Natsuki, but still, the conversations are not as romantic or passionate as one may expect. Everyday stuff with a little teasing, and that's it. It kind of fits my ideal of a good relationship between a boy and a girl, something of Platonic love. I'm not debasing sexual relationship, but pure love is, to me, more precious given the prevalence of the prior one. Cause Sayori is helping out Monika, you cannot choose to help either of them.

Back to this morning. The welcomed protag decides to visit Sayori before Natsuki/Yuri's arrival. Sayori reveals that she suffers from heavy depression, and hope that the he just forget about her and get along with other girls. But she also admits her feeling heartbroken seeing his having a good time with them, without actually realizing that it's out of jealousy. Sayori shows up again, and after Natsuki/Yuri is gone, she confesses her love for our protagonist. Here you have two options: accept it or not. If you choose to accept it, the two of them hugs each other and on and on. If not, Sayori breaks down, with a cry she runs away.

I'm glad I choosed to confess the love in my first run. Hope I've brought her some "hxppy thxughts"[1](#happy-thoughts).

Either way, on the day of the festival, you'll see her last poem on the literature club's pamphlet. Named *%*, it's dark and well, a lot creepier than her second poem.

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
But a poem is never finished
It just stops moving
{% endblockquote %}

The quote comes from Paul Valery, a French poet: *A poem is never finished, just abandoned.* A poem is never finished, because it's intrinsic to the poet. It's a part of the poet themself, whether about their feelings or experiences. In this sense, all poems written by the same people are in fact a continuous flow of the poet's personal experiences. So a poem can never be finished in this way, it's just like some underground rivers, some streams seemingly seperated by rocks are in fact connected together. And if this flow just stops moving...think you get the point.

The poem reminds you of everything. Of her creepy one on the third day, of her leave on Friday, of her telling you she's suffering from heavy depression in the weekend.

No, it can't be. You keep assuring yourself. It's just a mediocre visual novel, only appealing to those weebs who can't even stand a non-virgin, easily afraid theres no way Sayori will do something she's fine just a little depres wont do anything shes ok shes ok shes ok she must be ok god she must be ok

But that feeling can't go away.

The screen turns black after you enter Sayori's house. When it goes bright again, Sayori is there.

Her body is there.

And everything speeds from bad to worse since. The game restarts, but this time without Sayori. Her sprite in the title screen is replaced by an amalgam of the other members' pixels. All previous saves become unloadable(saying you cannot find Sayori's character file) and then deleted. Then the story unrolls as if Sayori never existed.

Now the game have glitches here and there, and things are exacerbating for Natsuki and Yuri. They have a quarrel on the same day as before, but without Sayori this time, it remains unchecked. 

If you've triggered Natsuki's event this day, she'll faint while talking to the protagonist, which, by Monika, is due to her malnutrition. And Natsuki hints that she's suffering from home abuse. When it comes to Yuri, she begins to show somewhat excessive obsession with MC.

Fear of the unknown may be a little more fundamental than other phobias. One is constantly scared, because what will come out next, is completely out of imagination.
