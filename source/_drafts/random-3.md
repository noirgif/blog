Some may wonder what's up with the 3 in the url. To tell the truth, that's because I have a draft named "random-2", so in order to avoid duplicate names, it becomes random-3.

As the title suggests, this article will just be a flow of thoughts. I'm trying to put new ideas down while coming up with them at the same time, and see how far I can go.

To start a conversation, I sometimes like to begin with some seemingly deep but mediocre questions, like:

Since when has the sky become so bright and blue?

A short answer will be: a while after this morning, when the long wavelength part of visible light is deflected, rather than the shorter part. Rayleigh scattering is the name for the phenomenon.

But looking things from a more huge perspective, to make Rayleigh scattering happen, we need air on earth. So it could be dated back to when the atmosphere is formed, that is nearly as old as the earth itself.

As a result, disregarding air pollution and the extinction event near the end of Cretaceous, usually the sky should be always as blue as it should be. Probably.

One is free to wonder if the blue sky we see today is the same as our ancestors saw tens of thousands of years ago. But the question itself is still lame as it sounds. I don't like to ask dumbbbbbbbb questions. Maybe we can change it for a little and see how it goes, someone might call it gradient descent.

Since when has the sky become so bright and green?

TBH, I myself would also be dumbfounded if asked such a question. The sky is never green -- it's orange, black or blue, but never green. One may think of color blindness, but even the closest color blindness we could get -- Tritanopia, defect of cone cells sensing blue light -- does not make one perceive the sky as green.

Aurora? That may be an answer, since aurorae are usually green, though they do not cover the whole sky.

Perhaps someone grew algae in the sky, and messed everything up. See, the sky is just as blue as the sea does, why cannot algae grow in the sky as they do in the sea? Or maybe we are tricked into believing some part of the sky is just part of the sea or ocean. Some day an alien could come to the earth and be mused at the sight of a bunch of Earthians swimming in the sky...whatever.

Another thing may worries human is the pollution, with pollution we can do anything. For example pollution can morph usually little creatures like rats and roaches into large hideous monsters. So painting the sky green will be just a piece of cake.

The b key on my keyboard is acting funny, I'll try finishing this post forgoing it.

As a result, I can only use am, is, and are, instead of their infinitive form. And I have to word myself around it. However, things may turn out just fine without a single letter. It it is really the case, I can then send an appeal to remove this letter from the alpha...list of letters. Lame.

Return to the greenish sky. Now we've got a part of my computer to agree that the sky is not cyan, that's a giant step forward. Yet get vigilant: the more hastily we're progressing, the worse are the mistakes we're going to make. That does stand for things other than space programs, too.

How a. another thought? The sky itself never turned green, it is our senses tricked us into thinking it is so. For example, one day suddenly all people started to  call the hue of the ocean 'green', whereas the chroma of meadows and tree leaves are renamed  ... not even close!

However, as President Lincoln once said, you cannot fool all people at all times, it is extremely difficult to have all earthlings undergo such paradigm shift. So to achieve this feat we need something much  more powerful, to force every human on this planet to see things in a new way. A highly contagious virus could play the tricks. With this weapon we can wrap up a story easily. SCP-8900-EX is a near example.
