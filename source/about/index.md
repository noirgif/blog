## The name of the blog

The name comes from Noire, one of the main characters in Hyperdimension Neptunia series by Compile Heart and Idea Factory.

## What you'd expect from this blog

The blogger once wanted to make this blog more technical. However, perhaps out of his lack of technical skills, he finds himself less attracted to writing posts about these problems than writing things that he thinks are interesting.

So this blog is filled with games and random writings.

Maybe it's bad. I don't know, or I don't want to admit.
