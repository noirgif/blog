Weather: 🌞Sunny

I had a longed-for eight-hour sleep yesterday. Or today because I was awake around 2am. And I hurried to finish a unit in Duolingo as promised. 

And I made the same mistake twice.

"에서" means "from", and "에" means "to". "가요" means "go" so it works with "to". Meanwhile, "와요" — "come" — pairs with "from". Next time it won’t beat me.

When I started the diary today, it became clear that I had not filled out the weather yesterday. I knew it was cloudy -- I checked the weather. But I chose not to prefill it: I wanted to witness it myself.

And I witnessed a 100% sunny day today. It is 19C outside! Warmly lovely sun. I appreciate it. I can wear no tights without feeling cold today.

Are the flowers blooming? I want to check out the arboretum someday. A search through the Internet gave me nothing but rough dates, and even the arboretum home page gave me the image that its residents' flimsy moods are unfathomable.

Instead, I found a planting calendar. It says that we should plant basil around the end of March here. I didn't know it two years earlier. I received some basil seeds and a gardening tool set at the end of summer 2021. And I planted it after that. Despite basil being acknowledged as an easy plant, it couldn't thrive. Its stems were slim and weak, its leaves small and yellow. The frigid winter in Wisconsin denied it the essential sunlight.

Like in *Klara and the Sun,* I wished the sun could bring it back to life. But in the end, it was in vain. After a year and a half, it dawned on me what went wrong.

Annoyed by Grammarly being fussy at small problems like punctuation, I found [this article](https://dept.writing.wisc.edu/blog/revisiting-grammarly/). It discusses the advantages and implications of these autocorrecting tools.

A generated summary of it:

{% quote Revisiting Grammarly: An Imperfect Tool for Final Editing – Another Word %}
This article is about the use of Grammarly, an automated written corrective feedback (AWCF) software, in the writing center. The author, who works as a Faculty Associate in the Writing Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, revisits the software five years after first trying it and discusses the potential implications of using the software in a writing center. Recent research has shown that students understand the limitations of Grammarly and use it strategically for final paper editing. However, the author has concerns about what this implies for linguistic justice, as it reinforces a rigid and harmful notion of a standard English that's earned its status through global white supremacy. The author concludes that, while they wouldn't advocate for students who aren't already using Grammarly to start using it, they will consider sharing information about the research findings when working with students who are concerned about lower-order concerns.

This led me to think about [a popular tweet](https://twitter.com/Nishimuraumiush/status/1644690023420416000) I saw. “If you feel disregarded, you might well have some language problems. ” It quotes another tweet that recommends elementary language practices.

I do think they both share an interesting point: making a problem to solve it. Grammarly gives low scores to articles and offers solutions to those nonproblems, to make people appreciate it. This tweet thrives by making people question themselves. It shuffled the focus from “Do you make elementary-level mistakes?” to a broader problem.

Admittedly, they are useful: Grammarly can fix many grammar mistakes; doing simple practices may strengthen confidence. But we should know our problem and not get carried away.

As part of the memory-switching test, I put the stick into another slot. My laptop shut down two times in succession. Again, too early to enjoy.
