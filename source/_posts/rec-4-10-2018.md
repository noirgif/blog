### Knowledge base && Inferrence
    * Truth table

    * Brute force search

    * Forward chaining
        * reliable
        * completeness
            * -> only have these two properties for the knowledge bases able to be expressed with Horn clauses
            * Horn clause: a disjunction of literals with at most one unnegated literal
                * E.g. $\neg x_1 \vee \neg x_2 \vee \cdots \vee x_n \vee u$

    * Backward chaining
        * To prove q, with p->q now prove p
        * Avoid repeating by check if a clause is already proved or disproved

### Programming Languages

#### Polymorphic Functions
* Static: cost grows exponentially with parameters
* Dynamic:
    * supply a tag when calling the function

#### Example: Overloading Equality

1. Equality was overloaded as an operator
2. Make type of equality fully polymorphic
3. Make equality polymorphic in a limited way
    * `(==) :: ''t -> ''t -> Bool`, `''t` is a type `t` with equality
    * will be a static error if `t` is not Eq type

#### Type Classes
1. Merchanism in Haskell
2. Dictionary-passing style implementation [ESOP1988]
    * Type class declaration -- dictionary
    * Name of a type class method -- label in the dictionary
    * Parametric overloading -- passing the dictionary to the function

```haskell
class Show a where
    show :: a -> String

instance Show Bool where
    show True = "True"
    show False = "False"

print :: Show a => a -> IO ()
print x = putStrLn $ show x
```

```ocaml
type 'a show = {show: 'a -> string}
let show_bool : bool show = 
{
    show = function
        | true -> "True"
        | false -> "False"
}

let print : 'a show -> 'a -> unit =
    fun {show=show} x -> print_endline (show x)
```

### Smalltalk: subtyping

* Object -> super class
         -> method table

* If interface A contains all of interface B, then A objects can also be used as B objects
    * need to look up all instances(members) at runtime

Javascript has the same problem
* v8 engine: hidden class
```javascript
function Person(first_name, last_name) {
    this.first_name = first_name;
    this.last_name = last_name;
}

var potus = new Person('D.', 'Trump');
var potrf = new Person('V.', 'Putin');
```
