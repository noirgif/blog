## Facts about Bash/Dash/sh

* Arch Linux uses Bash(Bourne Again Shell) for POSIX shell (/bin/sh)
* When Bash is called with `sh`, it tries to emulate the POSIX shell
* Dash is POSIX compatible, making it Bash incompatible.

## Facts about of V-Table

In C++, the virtual table pointer is located in the head of the class instance.

The virtual table is a table of pointer to virtual(overridden or not) functions.

Therefore, to invoked these virtual methods, a mechanism called thunk(a jocular form of think) is needed. It means doing something before the actual function is called. And functional language relies largely on this mechanism.

## Fact about Zeromq

* It is a distributed communication library.
* It sits on top of the TCP/IP layer, means the possibility is huge that it sends message by syscalls like `send`.

## Facts about lttng

* Means Linux Tracing Tool, next generation
* In Artful repo, for older Ubuntu versions, go to ppa:lttng
* Can be used to trace syscall, or even user application(need to write code into the program)
* `babeltrace` could be used to translate the file.

## Facts about Ubuntu

* The life span of Zesty(17.04) has ended in Jan. 2018. Artful will meets its end in Jul. 2018.
* The life span of non-LTS versions is 9 months.
* 18.04 is called Bionic, will upgrade later

## Facts about Opam

The package manager of OCaml. Not a kind of mineral.

## Facts about type algebra

Refer to [this page](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/three/algebra-and-calculus-of-algebraic-data-types).

The type could be expressed in an algebra-like manner:

0: None type, there is 0 way to construct an empty type object

1: Singleton

2: Two ways to construct the type, boolean type is an example

{% katex %}
+
{% endkatex %}: Sum type, the object of type {% katex %}
a+b
{% endkatex %} could be either type a or type b, but not both, there are exactly {% katex %}
a+b
{% endkatex %} ways to construct the object. Injection is used to construct an instance, if it is called an instance.

{% katex %}
\times
{% endkatex %}: Product type, the object of type {% katex %}
a\times b
{% endkatex %} is a combination of an object of type a and one of type b. OCaml adopts this notation, an constructor applied to type {% katex %}
a\times b
{% endkatex %} is written as `Foo of a*b`.

And as a surprising yet unsurprising coincidence, the sum and product obey the rules:

Communicative: {% katex %}
a+b=b+a
{% endkatex %}

Associative: {% katex %}
a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c
{% endkatex %}

Distributive: {% katex %}
a\times(b+c)=a\times b+a\times c
{% endkatex %}

For recursive types like the tree, which is

```haskell
data Tree a = Leaf a | Branch (Tree a) (Tree a)
```

The formula is:

{% katex %}
T = a + T^2
{% endkatex %}

Therefore, we have:

{% katex %}
 T^2-T+a=0  
{% endkatex %}

{% katex %}
 T = \frac{1-\sqrt{1-4a}}{2} 
{% endkatex %} (Why choose the minus sign?)

Use Taylor series, we could obtain:

{% katex %}
 T=1 + a + a^2 + 2 a^3 + 5 a^4 + 14 a^5 + 42 a^6 \cdots 
{% endkatex %}

And the coefficients of a are Catalan numbers.



[Zippers](http://learnyouahaskell.com/zippers) means we could turn the pocket inside out and focus on one element in a data structure, in a way that updating the focused element , as well as moving the focus around, takes {% katex %}
O(1)
{% endkatex %} time.

And we can focus on the holes of a type.

{% katex %}
a\times b
{% endkatex %} has one hole of a

{% katex %}
a+a
{% endkatex %} has two holes of a, that is `data _, a` and `data a, _`

It is likened to partial differentiation, for example:

{% katex %}
 \frac{\partial (u \times v)}{\partial a} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial a} \times v + \frac{\partial v}{\partial a} \times u 
{% endkatex %}

If {% katex %}
\frac{\partial t}{\partial a}
{% endkatex %} means the hole numbers of a in t, and let the g of constant be zero, and g of other variables be one, then magic!

It can be applied to the list type:

```haskell
data List a = [] | Cons a (List a)
```

{% katex %}
 L=1+aL 
{% endkatex %}, take both sides' derivative of a, we got:

{% katex %}
 \frac{\partial L}{\partial a} = L + \frac{\partial L}{\partial a} \times a 
{% endkatex %}

{% katex %}
 \frac{\partial L}{\partial a}=\frac{L}{1-a} 
{% endkatex %} and{% katex %}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial a}=L^2
{% endkatex %}. Bravo! That is the zipper type, one pointing to left and the other right.

Added 3/29:

But the same thing could not be perfectly applied to the binary tree type.

Recall, we have the binary tree type:

```haskell
data Tree a = Leaf | Branch a (Tree a) (Tree a)
```

Then the formula is:

{% katex %}
 T=1+aT^2 
{% endkatex %}

The best I could get is about:

{% katex %}
\frac{\partial T}{\partial a}=T^2L
{% endkatex %}, and the {% katex %}
L
{% endkatex %} is a list of type {% katex %}
2aT
{% endkatex %}.

According to [LYAHFGG](http://learnyouahaskell.com/zippers), the zipper of a binary tree should be something like this:

```haskell
data Crumbs a = LeftCrumb a (Tree a) | RightCrumb a (Tree a)
type BreadCrumbs a = [Crumbs a]
type Zipper a = (Tree a, Breadcrumbs a)  
```

It is easy to see that `Crumbs a` has a type of {% katex %}
2aT
{% endkatex %} and `BreadCrumbs a` has a type of {% katex %}
\frac{1}{1-2aT}
{% endkatex %}.

But wait! That gives {% katex %}
T
{% endkatex %} rather than a {% katex %}
T^2
{% endkatex %} in the numerator.

Maybe we've just started wrong, like, we took the wrong differentiation.

That would be left for future investigation.
